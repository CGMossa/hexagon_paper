# Spatial variance of carrying capacity in a host-pathogen setting

## Outline

* African Swine Fever (ASF) is self-sustaining in the wild boar
  population [@taylor_predicting_2019]
  and thus there are growing interest in modelling the spill-over events onto
  the domestic pig farms.

* Discritising a landscape into a regular grid or even a lattice is often considered
  when studying ecological systems, that involve assimilating different resolution
  sources together. Rectangular grids are often used, even in cases where
  hexagonal grids might be more suited. In [@birch_rectangular_2007-1] it is highlighted
  that hexagon grids are better when nearest neighbourhood, connectivity and movement
  paths are important.

  Equilateral triangular lattices (or hexagonal lattice) are not ill-fit for
  population-based mathematical models. In [@hamilton_hexagonal_2013] it is shown
  that they can compete with a rectilinear grids. 
  (Wave equation `~=` population-based mathematical models)

* [??] Why not triangles? To tesseletate triangles on a surface, you need both
  triangles that point north, and down; Hexagons don't, either pointy-top or flat topped [@noauthor_red_nodate].

* [??] Nested sampling schemes easier done with hexagons [@jurasinski_spatial_2006].

* Carrying capacity (CC) drives the dynamics of the wildlife population [@iijima_spatial_2016],
  and the locally spatial variation of carrying capacity influences the
  reproduction and survival of wildlife [@saether_geographical_2008].

  In [@scherer_moving_2020] spatial variation of CC is examined, together with
  the type of dispersal and the effect of these on the outbreak measures.

* Current approaches to carrying capacity in modelling ASF/CSF in wild boar uses
  randomised carrying capacity, which breaks down any spatial hetereogenity,
  that exist in the real world.

  In this paper we consider the carrying capacity as a function of Corine
  Landuse data, as an example of spatial hetetreogenic preserving strategy.
  Equivalently, for a random counterpart, the same grid is used, but the locations
  of these carrying capacities will be shuffled.

* Current approaches for attributing breeding capacity to grid cells uses an
  estimated wild boar density [@pittiglio_wild_2018-1] and [@jedrzejewska_factors_1997]
  is done in [@lange_elucidating_2017-1]. They do suggest combining Corine Landuse
  as a way to reverse back to a density dependence, but this is not done.

  For Denmark, there are very little area in which wild boar have been present,
  and thus defining a proxy to habitat quality is necessary. In [@halasa_simulation_2019]
  breeding capacity is assigned according to a PERT distribution on cells that
  satisfy a habitat threshold. 

* There are many approaches to generate a mesh of a landscape. Most aim for
  tractable properties when used in contiunuous/mathematical models;
  For simulation-based models, this is not required, thus a discretisation of
  a landscape may be built with other criteria. In this paper we explore (???) ways:
  (@hexagon_patches) Every cell represents an atomic grouping of wild boars; A wild boar group with
  a matriac and the cell is the center of their home-range [see @leaper_feasibility_1999 for home-range size]
  (@voronoi_patches) Every cell is attributed to a pig farm, and the area signifies the area
  in which present wild boar groups may infect (or vice versa) a pig farm.
  
  In (@hexagon_patches) we use hexagon mesh, where for (@voronoi_patches)
  the mesh is generated through Dirichlet / Voronoi tesselation.
  
  Voronoi tesselation may also be used to aggregate areal-based predictors
  in an analysis through Thiessen method, see [@jurado_why_2018].
  In [@lunn_counterintuitive_2022] they do use Dirichlet tesselation a scaling
  between a host-pathogen coverage.
