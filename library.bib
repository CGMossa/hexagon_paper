In this context, Agent-Based Model (ABM) can be seen as an innovative tool for modelling real-world complex simulations. This paper presents Rust-AB, an open-source library for developing ABM simulation on sequential and/or parallel computing platforms, exploiting Rust as programming language. The Rust-AB architecture as well as an investigation on the ability of Rust to develop ABM simulations are discussed. An ABM simulation written in Rust-AB, and a performance comparison against the well-adopted Java ABM toolkit MASON is also presented.},

A key element in any statistical simulation is the existence of an appropriate data-generating process: one must be able to simulate data from a specified statistical model. We describe data-generating processes for the Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates when event times follow an exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz distribution. We consider three types of time-varying covariates: first, a dichotomous time-varying covariate that can change at most once from untreated to treated (e.g., organ transplant); second, a continuous time-varying covariate such as cumulative exposure at a constant dose to radiation or to a pharmaceutical agent used for a chronic condition; third, a dichotomous time-varying covariate with a subject being able to move repeatedly between treatment states (e.g., current compliance or use of a medication). In each setting, we derive closed-form expressions that allow one to simulate survival times so that survival times are related to a vector of fixed or time-invariant covariates and to a single time-varying covariate. We illustrate the utility of our closed-form expressions for simulating event times by using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the statistical power to detect as statistically significant the effect of different types of binary time-varying covariates.

  abstract = {Our capacity to predict patterns of animal movement behavior is limited by our understanding of the underlying cognitive process. Determining what an animal knows about its environment, and how that information is translated into specific movement behaviors, is a conceptual challenge faced by movement ecologists. The modeling framework presented here is designed to evaluate the likelihood of alternative processes of perception, memory and decision making, based on readily available positional data and environmental metrics. The model is based on a flexible cognitive algorithm that provides the framework for an adaptive movement kernel. This enables a straightforward methodology for estimating key parameters for sensory perception, memory and movement while providing testable predictions of animal resource selection and space use patterns. In addition to describing the model and explaining the underlying logic, we demonstrate its parameterization potential using simulated data and investigate the robustness of its predictions over a wide range of temporal and spatial sampling scales. We show that the model can reproduce descriptive probes of movement paths with little sensitivity to the scale at which these paths were sampled and we discuss the merits of our approach in the context of movement- and cognitive-ecology and evolution. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Seasonality in time of birth was evident, with piglets born in winter and spring (1980) or spring and summer (1981). Litter size as measured by fetal counts was 5.00 ? 0.36 and sows averaged 0.86 ? 0.17 litters over a 12-month period.

  abstract = {The tortuosity of an animal's path is a key parameter in orientation and searching behaviours. The tortuosity of an oriented path is inversely related to the efficiency of the orientation mechanism involved, the best mechanism being assumed to allow the animal to reach its goal along a straight line movement. The tortuosity of a random search path controls the local searching intensity, allowing the animal to adjust its search effort to the local profitability of the environment. This paper shows that (1) the efficiency of an oriented path can be reliably estimated by a straightness index computed as the ratio between the distance from the starting point to the goal and the path length travelled to reach the goal, but such a simple index, ranging between 0 and 1, cannot be applied to random search paths; (2) the tortuosity of a random search path, ranging between straight line movement and Brownian motion, can be reliably estimated by a sinuosity index which combines the mean cosine of changes of direction with the mean step length; and (3) in the current state of the art, the fractal analysis of animals' paths, which may appear as an alternative and promising way to measure the tortuosity of a random search path as a fractal dimension ranging between 1 (straight line movement) and 2 (Brownian motion), is only liable to generate artifactual results. This paper also provides some help for distinguishing between oriented and random search paths, and depicts a general, comprehensive framework for analysing individual animals' paths in a two-dimensional space.},

  abstract = {1. In terrestrial ecosystems many species show large population fluctuations caused by pulsed resources, such as mast seeding. A prime example of a mammal strongly affected by mast seeding of trees is the wild boar Sus scrofa, a species that has become a pest in many parts of the world. We investigated the population dynamics of wild boar to assist the development of effective management strategies for this species and possibly for other pulsed resource consumers. 2. We analysed published vital rates of wild boar using Leslie matrix projection models and elasticity analysis. Models were based on vital rates of animals under poor, intermediate and good environmental conditions, which represent combinations of differences in food availability (particularly mast of beech Fagus sylvatica and/or oak Quercus spp.) and winter climate. 3. Interestingly, we observed a crossover in the ranking of elasticities (e; the relative impact of each vital rate on population growth rate {$\lambda$}) when comparing different conditions. While the elasticity of {$\lambda$} to adult survival was highest in poor environments [e(P adult) = 0.36, e(Pjuvenile) = 0.22], the elasticity of {$\lambda$} to juvenile survival was highest under good conditions [e(P adult) = 0.16, e(Pjuvenile) = 0.28]. Thus juvenile survival becomes increasingly important for population growth as habitat conditions improve. 4. Our analysis of empirical beech mast records gave some indication of an increase of full masts over the last few decades. Modelling different beech mast scenarios showed that an increase in full mast frequency will lead to a rapid increase in {$\lambda$}. The availability of alternative food resources, namely agricultural crops, may also contribute to an expansion of wild boar populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that, whenever possible, management strategies should be based on separate elasticity analyses for different environmental conditions, especially for species dependent on pulsed resources. For wild boar we suggest the following principal management strategies to stop further population increases: (i) supplementary feeding should be strictly avoided; (ii) under good environmental conditions, reducing juvenile survival will have the largest effect on {$\lambda$}, whereas strong hunting pressure on adult females will lead to most effective population control in years with poor conditions. \textcopyright{} 2005 British Ecological Society.},

It was not possible to demonstrate an effect of natural barriers on ASF spread. Human-mediated translocation may override any effect of natural barriers. Recommendations for ASF control in four different epidemiological scenarios are presented.}

  abstract = {Denmark has no free-range wild-boar population. However, Danish wildlife organizations have suggested that wild boar should be reintroduced into the wild to broaden national biodiversity. Danish pig farmers fear that this would lead to a higher risk of introduction of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), which could have enormous consequences in terms of loss of pork exports. We conducted a risk assessment to address the additional risk of introducing and spreading CSFV due to the reintroduction of wild boar. In this paper, we present the part of the risk assessment that deals with the spread of CSFV between the hypothetical wild-boar population and the domestic population. Furthermore, the economic impact is assessed taking the perspective of the Danish national budget and the Danish pig industry. We used InterSpreadPlus to model the differential classical swine fever (CSF) risk due to wild boar. Nine scenarios were run to elucidate the effect of: (a) presence of wild boar (yes/no), (b) locations for the index case (domestic pig herd/wild-boar group), (c) type of control strategy for wild boar (hunting/vaccination) and (d) presence of free-range domestic pigs. The presence of free-range wild boar was simulated in two large forests using data from wildlife studies and Danish habitat data. For each scenario, we estimated (1) the control costs borne by the veterinary authorities, (2) the control-related costs to farmers and (3) the loss of exports associated with an epidemic. Our simulations predict that CSFV will be transmitted from the domestic pig population to wild boar if the infected domestic pig herd is located close to an area with wild boar ({$<$}5km). If an outbreak begins in the wild-boar population, the epidemic will last longer and will occasionally lead to several epidemics because of periodic transfer of virus from groups of infected wild boar to domestic pig herds. The size and duration of the epidemic will be reduced if there are no free-range domestic pig herds in the area with CSF-infected wild boar. The economic calculations showed that the total national costs for Denmark (i.e. the direct costs to the national budget and the costs to the pig industry) related to an outbreak of CSF in Denmark will be highly driven by the reactions of the export markets and in particular of the non-EU markets. Unfortunately, there is a substantial amount of uncertainty surrounding this issue. If hunting is used as a control measure, the average expenses related to a CSF outbreak will be 40\% higher if wild boar are present compared with not present. However, a vaccination strategy for wild boar will double the total costs compared with a hunting strategy.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most important diseases in Suidae due to its significant health and socioeconomic consequences and represents a major threat to the European pig industry, especially in the absence of any available treatment or vaccine. In fact, with its high mortality rate and the subsequent trade restrictions imposed on affected countries, ASF can dramatically disrupt the pig industry in afflicted countries. In September 2018, ASF was unexpectedly identified in wild boars from southern Belgium in the province of Luxembourg, not far from the Franco-Belgian border. The French authorities rapidly commissioned an expert opinion on the risk of ASF introduction and dissemination into metropolitan France. In Europe, the main transmission routes of the virus comprise direct contact between infected and susceptible animals and indirect transmission through contaminated material or feed. However, the seasonality of the disease in some pig farms in Baltic countries, including outbreaks in farms with high biosecurity levels, have led to questions on the possible involvement of arthropods in the transmission of the virus. This review explores the current body of knowledge on the most common arthropod families present in metropolitan France. We examine their potential role in spreading ASF\textemdash by active biological or mechanical transmission or by passive transport or ingestion\textemdash in relation to their bio-ecological properties. It also highlights the existence of significant gaps in our knowledge on vector ecology in domestic and wild boar environments and in vector competence for ASFV transmission. Filling these gaps is essential to further understanding ASF transmission in order to thus implement appropriate management measures.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Despite efforts to prevent the appearance and spread of African swine fever (ASF) in the European Union, several Member States are now affected (Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and Estonia). Disease appearance in 2014 was associated with multiple entrances linked to wild boar movement from endemic areas (EFSA Journal, 8, 2015, 1556), but the risk of new introductions remains high (Gallardo et~al., Porcine Health Management, 1, and 21) as ASF continues to be active in endemic countries (Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine). Since 2014, the number of ASF notifications has increased substantially, particularly in wild boar (WB), in parallel with slow but constant geographical advance of the disease. This situation suggests a real risk of further disease spread into other Member States, posing a great threat to pig production in the EU. Following the principles of the risk-based veterinary surveillance, this article applies a methodology developed by De la Torre et~al. (Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 62, and 272) to assess the relative risk of new introductions of ASF by natural movements of WB according to the current epidemiological situation. This update incorporates the most recent available data and an improved version of the most important risk estimator: an optimized cartographic tool of WB distribution to analyse wild boar suitable habitat. The highest relative risk values were estimated for Slovakia (5) and Romania (5), followed by Finland (4), Czech Republic (3) and Germany (3). Relative risk for Romania and Finland is associated mainly with disease entrance from endemic areas such as the Russian Federation and Ukraine, where the disease is currently spreading; relative risk for Germany and Czech Republic is associated mainly with the potential progress of the disease through the EU, and relative risk for Slovakia is associated with both pathways. WB habitat is the most important risk estimator, whereas WB density is the least significant, suggesting that WB presence is more relevant than density. These results can provide actionable advice for dealing with risk. They can be directly used to inform risk-based national strategies and identify countries that may need to pay greater attention to surveillance or conduct additional evaluations at the subnational level.},

The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic\textendash mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times. The approach can also identify the spatial origin of spreading processes and successfully be applied to data of the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic.},

  abstract = {A positive relationship between clutch size or litter size and latitude exists in birds and many species of small mammal. Hitherto, however, analyses for large mammals have failed to provide evidence that litter sizes increase with latitude. We collated data from published studies of wild boar in Europe, to analyse the relationship between litter size and latitude in this widely distributed terrestrial mammal. Depending on the specific data set (whether only the most reliable data or all available data were included), latitude explained 58\% to 72\% of the variation in mean litter sizes across studies. On average, litter size increases by approximately 0.15 piglets per degree of latitude. A strong correlation between litter size and latitude for wild boar in Europe provides a starting point for demographic modelling of this species of both ecological and economic importance.5. The pattern for wild boar is consistent with Ashmole's explanation for the effects of latitude on reproduction. The contrast between our results and those generated for other large mammals may result from our focus on an herbivore in contrast to previous work which was focused on carnivores. Further work could usefully examine the extent of seasonality in the availability of resources for species of different dietary types. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Authors.

The review identifies and discusses a range of models based on a wide variety of data types, corresponding to those targeted by the data collection model set by ENETwild, such as occurrence data (presence-only, presence-background and presence-absence), hunting bag data and density data. The reviewed models are categorised in two main groups, the first based on occurrence data to predict a distribution of wild boar, and the second based on hunting bag, census and/or density data to directly model abundance. Owing to the diversity of methodologies, an ensemble modelling approach is here proposed for combining the outputs from a range of complimentary models and generating density estimates of wild boar at European scale. This would retain the flexibility necessary to utilise all available data whilst maintaining a robust output. An initial model has been outlined which uses occurrence data to generate wild boar distribution across Europe. The resulting suitability scores are related to available density estimates to establish a relationship, so the suitability map can be converted into a map of absolute density. In order to further utilize other types of data in this framework, the produced outputs of prediction of habitat suitability or presence/absence are used to underpin models based on available abundance data (hunting bag, census or density).},

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease affecting all suids including wild boar. As the disease can damage commercial pig production and its circulation can threaten international trade, understanding the risks produced by free-living wild boar (as a wildlife reservoir) is important to ensure proportionate policies to exclude the disease, as well as an effective contingency response. The recent spread of the virus into Western Europe has produced concerns in many stakeholders including pig producers and national governments. Unlike in mainland Europe, where wild boar are widespread, in Britain, free-living populations have only recently re-established, and whilst these are still relatively small and isolated, they may provide a sufficient reservoir capable of sustaining disease and may thus present a continual source of infection risk to domestic pigs. This study focuses on one component of the risk produced by wild boar, specifically the distribution and persistence of virus in a landscape produced by the natural circulation of disease within wild boar. We used a spatial individual-based model run across a representation of a real landscape to explore the epidemiological consequences of an introduction of ASF into the Forest of Dean, currently hosting the largest population of wild boar in England. We explore various scenarios including variations in the prophylactic management of boar, as well as variations in reactive management (contingency response) following the detection of disease to evaluate their value in reducing this specific risk (presence of ASF virus of wild boar origin in the landscape). The abundance and distribution of wild boar is predicted to increase across our study extent over the next 20 years. Outbreaks of ASF are not predicted to be self-sustaining, with the median time to disease ``burn-out'' (no new infections) being 14 weeks. Carcass removal, as a tool in a package of reactive management, was of limited value in reducing the duration of outbreaks in this study. We suggest that useful predictions of some of the risks produced by ASF might be possible using only the distribution of the boar, rather than more difficult abundance or density measures.},

The ecological and economic impact of this species include spread of diseases, vehicle collisions, damage to crops, amenities and infrastructures and reduction in plant and animal abundance and richness. As traditional methods such as culling have not contained the growth and spread of wild boar and feral pigs, alternative methods such as fertility control are now advocated. We used empirical data on two isolated wild boar populations to model and compare the effects of different regimes of culling and fertility control on population trends. We built a Bayesian population model and applied it to explore the implications for population control of various management options combining culling and/or contraception. The results showed that, whilst fertility control on its own was not sufficient to achieve the target reduction in wild boar number, adding fertility control to culling was more effective than culling alone. In particular, using contraceptives on 40\% of the population to complement the culling of 60\% of the animals, halved the time to achieve our target reduction compared with culling only. We conclude that, assuming the effort of adding fertility control to culling was found to be cost-effective in terms of population reduction, these two methods should be used simultaneously if a rapid decrease in wild boar number is required for a closed population.},

The data related to the wild boar dispersal distance can have a complex structure, including excess of zeros and right-censored observations, thus being challenging for modeling. In this sense, we propose two different zero-inflated-right-censored regression models, assuming Weibull and gamma distributions. First, we present the construction of the likelihood function, and then, we apply both models to simulated datasets, demonstrating that both regression models behave well. The simulation results point to the consistency and asymptotic unbiasedness of the developed methods. Afterwards, we adjusted both models to a simulated dataset of wild boar dispersal, including excess of zeros, right-censored observations, and two covariates: age and sex. We showed that the models were useful to extract inferences about the wild boar dispersal, correctly describing the data mimicking a situation where males disperse more than females, and age has a positive effect on the dispersal of the wild boars. These results are useful to overcome some limitations regarding inferences in zero-inflated-right-censored datasets, especially concerning the wild boar's population. Users will be provided with an R function to run the proposed models.},

A peak in the ASF incidence was observed 6~months after the first observed case, followed by a significant reduction of the number of cases and low levels of African swine fever virus (ASFV) circulation at the end of 38~months follow-up period at different spatial resolutions. The spatial analysis concluded that human-mediated spread of ASFV continues to play a critical role in the ASF epidemiology, despite all measures currently taken. ?Wild boar density?, ?total road length? (as proxy for human activity) and ?average suitable wild boar habitat availability? were identified as predictors for the occurrence of ASF in Estonia by a Bayesian hierarchical model, whereas ?wild boar density? and ?density of pig farms? were predictors according to a generalised additive model. To evaluate the preventive strategies proposed in EFSA's Scientific Opinion (2015) to stop the spread of ASFV in the wild boar population, a simulation model, building on expert knowledge and literature was used. It was concluded that reduction of wild boar population and carcass removal to stop the spread of ASFV in the wild boar population are more effective when applied preventively in the infected area. Drastic depopulation, targeted hunting of female wild boar and carcass removal solely implemented as measures to control ASF in the wild boar population need to be implemented in a highly effective manner (at or beyond the limit of reported effectivity in wild boar management) to sustainably halt the spread of ASF.},

The virus is extremely well adapted to replicate in its hosts in the sylvatic cycle in East and South Africa. Its spread to other regions, with different wildlife hosts, climatic conditions, and pig production systems, has revealed unexpected epidemiological scenarios and different challenges for control.

We apply these four approaches to three examples of species interactions in spatially distributed populations and compare their predictions. Each represents different assumptions about the biology and hence a comparison among them has biological as well as modeling implications. In the first case all four approaches agree, in the second the spatial models disagree with the nonspatial ones, while in the third the stochastic models with discrete individuals disagree with the ones based on differential equations. We show further that the limiting reaction-diffusion equations associated with particle systems can have different qualitative behavior from those obtained by simply adding diffusion terms to mean field equations. \textcopyright{} 1994 Academic Press.

All the important features of C are covered, including arrays, files, pointers, and structures, within biologically motivated simulations. Although computer simulations of extremely complicated biological processes are released from rigid mathematical constraints, each of the simulations is also placed in the context of a mathematical formulation examined either analytically or numerically.

For this, we used pigs that had survived an ASFV infection, had recovered from disease, and had become carriers of ASFV. These clinically healthy carriers were put together one-by-one with naive contact pigs. Two of the twelve contact pigs developed an acute ASFV infection. Using the results of the experiment we quantified the transmission parameters {$\beta$}carrier (0.039/day) and Tcarrier (25.4 days). With the survival rate of 0.3 for our ASFV isolate, these parameter values translate into the contribution of carriers to R0 in groups of pigs being 0.3. Further, we placed naive contact pigs in an ASFV contaminated environment. Here, no contact infections were observed. Our findings show that clinically healthy carriers can be a source of acute new infections, which can contribute to the persistence of ASFV in swine populations. The estimates that we provide can be used for modelling of transmission in domestic pigs and, in part, for modelling transmission in wild boar.},

  abstract = {The European Commission requested EFSA to compare the reliability of wild boar density estimates across the EU and to provide guidance to improve data collection methods. Currently, the only EU-wide available data are hunting data. Their collection methods should be harmonised to be comparable and to improve predictive models for wild boar density. These models could be validated by more precise density data, collected at local level e.g. by camera trapping. Based on practical and theoretical considerations, it is currently not possible to establish wild boar density thresholds that do not allow sustaining African swine fever (ASF). There are many drivers determining if ASF can be sustained or not, including heterogeneous population structures and human-mediated spread and there are still unknowns on the importance of different transmission modes in the epidemiology. Based on extensive literature reviews and observations from affected Member States, the efficacy of different wild boar population reduction and separation methods is evaluated. Different wild boar management strategies at different stages of the epidemic are suggested. Preventive measures to reduce and stabilise wild boar density, before ASF introduction, will be beneficial both in reducing the probability of exposure of the population to ASF and the efforts needed for potential emergency actions (i.e. less carcass removal) if an ASF incursion were to occur. Passive surveillance is the most effective and efficient method of surveillance for early detection of ASF in free areas. Following focal ASF introduction, the wild boar populations should be kept undisturbed for a short period (e.g. hunting ban on all species, leave crops unharvested to provide food and shelter within the affected area) and drastic reduction of the wild boar population may be performed only ahead of the ASF advance front, in the free populations. Following the decline in the epidemic, as demonstrated through passive surveillance, active population management should be reconsidered.},

Based on the assumption that intrinsic regulation will be manifest via direct density-dependent feedbacks, and extrinsic regulation via delayed density-dependent feedbacks, we fit autoregressive models to 30 time series of abundance for large and small mammals to characterize their dynamics. Delayed feedbacks characterizing extrinsic mechanisms, such as trophic-level interactions, were detected in most time series, including both small and large mammals. Spectral analyses indicated that the effect of such delayed feedbacks on the variability in population growth rates differed with body size, with large mammals exhibiting predominantly reddened and whitened spectra in contrast with predominantly blue spectra for small mammals. Large mammals showed less variance and more stable dynamics than small mammals, consistent with, among other factors, differences in their potential population growth rates. Patterns of population dynamics in small versus large mammals contradicted those predicted by the Caughley and Krebs hypothesis.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. The reintroduction of large mammals is often considered a priority conservation action in highly industrialized countries in which many of these species have been depleted. However, species reintroduction after decades of absence may involve important risks for human activities and ecological communities, such as favoring the spread of diseases. An example of a potentially troublesome reintroduction is the wild boar, which may act as a reservoir of diseases, e.g., classical swine fever, and cause high economic losses, and has become a species of concern in several European countries for both ecological and recreational reasons. Failure to prevent the disease consequences of species restoration can negate its conservation benefits. Here we evaluated the probability of both successfully reintroducing wild boar into Denmark and limiting their contact with domestic pig farms to which they might spread disease. For this purpose, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based population model that incorporates information on boar habitat and demography information from Central European populations. We then compared model predictions with the spatial distribution of farms to achieve a spatial assessment of the contact risk. The most restrictive model scenario predicted that nearly 6\% of Denmark provides habitat conditions that would allow wild boar to reproduce. The best habitats for reintroduction were aggregated in seven different areas throughout the country in which the extinction probability was {$<$} 5\%. However, the expected population expansion was very limited in most of these areas. Both the number of suitable areas and the potential for population expansion greatly increased when we relaxed our habitat assumptions about boar forest requirements; this provided a more conservative scenario for a cautious risk analysis. We additionally found that part of the risk of contact with piggeries was associated with the magnitude of the expansion, although the nonrandom spatial pattern of farm distribution also had a strong influence. The partitioning of risks into those related to population expansion and those related to farm distribution allowed us to identify trade-offs between restoring boar populations and minimizing risks in different potential areas and under different risk scenarios; as a result, we rejected some of the particularly high-risk areas for potential reintroduction of the species. Our approach illustrates how the joint quantification of anticipated reintroduction success and associated risks can guide efforts aimed at reconciling species recovery and the affected health and economic interests.},

Age-structured models were constructed with environmental randomness and density-dependence for the wild boar, because this species seems to be more deeply influenced by environmental factors than fallow deer. For the former species, the study showed, by simulation, that a mixed harvesting policy (constant effort plus fixed escapement) may work better than other, more commonly used, approaches.

We used capture-mark-recapture methods to model survival in a Mediterranean population (S. s. majori) of wild boars during an 8-year period, using a large sample of individually tagged animals of known age, to investigate demographic patterns and the effects of variable environmental conditions (e.g., summer droughts), which are believed to have a strong impact on the demography of this species. Contrary to the predictions based on our current knowledge of life-history theory, survival of wild boars differed less among age classes and between sexes than has been reported in other large mammals. As predicted from current theories on sexual selection, the impact of environmental factors was stronger on males than on females. This study documents for wild boars a life-history tactic different from the accepted model for large ungulates but similar to the tactic observed in small terrestrial mammals. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.},

We assumed that antibodies could be detected, after a fixed threshold prevalence of seroconverted milking cows was reached in the herd. Different thresholds were set for each ELISA, according to previous studies. For each test, antibody detection was simulated in small (70 cows), medium (150 cows) and large (320 cows) herds. The assays included were: (1) the Danish blocking ELISA, (2) the SVANOVIR\textregistered BVDV-Ab ELISA, and (3) the ELISA BVD/MD p80 Institute Pourquier. The validation of the model was mainly carried out by comparing the predicted incidence of persistently infected (PI) calves and the predicted detection time, with records from a BVD infected herd. Results showed that the SVANOVIR, which was the most efficient ELISA, could detect antibodies in the BTM of a large herd 280 days (95\% prediction interval: 218; 568) after a transiently infected (TI) milking cow has been introduced into the herd. The estimated time to detection after introduction of one PI calf was 111 days (44; 605). With SVANOVIR ELISA the incidence of PIs and dead born calves could be limited and the impact of the disease on the animal welfare and income of farmers (before detection) could be minimized. The results from the simulation modeling can be used to improve the current Danish BVD surveillance program in detecting early infected herds.},

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the underlying causes of this increase in order to be able to manage populations effectively. The purpose of this study was to analyse how environmental (food and climate) and physiological factors (maternal weight and age) as well as hunting and population density influence the litter size of wild boar populations in Northern Germany. The mean litter size in the studied population for the whole period was 6.6 (range 1-12), which is one of the highest in all of Europe. Litter size was positively influenced by maternal body weight, higher mast yield of oak as well as higher temperature in combination with higher precipitation in summer. Only higher temperature or only higher precipitation in summer however had a negative effect on litter size production. Probably,weather and food conditions act via maternal body weight on the litter size variation inwild boar. Hunting aswell as population density did not affect the litter size variation in this studywhich might indicate thatwild boar population did not reach carrying capacity yet.},

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of swine which causes high mortality, approaching 100\%, in domestic pigs. ASF is caused by a large, double stranded DNA virus, ASF virus (ASFV), which replicates predominantly in the cytoplasm of macrophages and is the only member of the Asfarviridae family, genus Asfivirus. The natural hosts of this virus include wild suids and arthropod vectors of the Ornithodoros genus. The infection of ASFV in its reservoir hosts is usually asymptomatic and develops a persistent infection. In contrast, infection of domestic pigs leads to a lethal hemorrhagic fever for which there is no effective vaccine. Identification of ASFV genes involved in virulence and the characterization of mechanisms used by the virus to evade the immune response of the host are recognized as critical steps in the development of a vaccine. Moreover, the interplay of the viral products with host pathways, which are relevant for virus replication, provides the basic information needed for the identification of potential targets for the development of intervention strategies against this disease.},

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is a serious global concern from an ecological and economic point of view. While it is well established that its main transmission routes comprise contact between infected and susceptible animals and transmission through contaminated carcasses, the specific mechanism leading to its long-term persistence is still not clear. Among others, a proposed mechanism involves the potential role of convalescent individuals, which would be able to shed the virus after the end of the acute infection. Using a spatially explicit, stochastic, individual-based model, we tested: (1) if ASF can persist when transmission occurs only through infected wild boars and infected carcasses; (2) if the animals that survive ASF can play a relevant role in increasing ASF persistence chances; (3) how hunting pressure can affect the ASF probability to persist. The scenario in which only direct and carcass-mediated transmission were contemplated had 52\% probability of virus persistence 10 years after the initial outbreak. The inclusion of survivor-mediated transmission corresponded to slightly higher persistence probabilities (57\%). ASF prevalence during the endemic phase was generally low, ranging 0.1\textendash 0.2\%. The proportion of seropositive individuals gradually decreased with time and ranged 4.5\textendash 6.6\%. Our results indicate that direct and carcass-mediated infection routes are sufficient to explain and justify the long-term persistence of ASF at low wild boar density and the ongoing geographic expansion of the disease front in the European continent. During the initial years of an ASF outbreak, hunting should be carefully evaluated as a management tool, in terms of potential benefits and negative side-effects, and combined with an intensive effort for the detection and removal of wild boar carcasses. During the endemic phase, further increasing hunting effort should not be considered as an effective strategy. Additional effort should be dedicated to finding and removing as many wild boar carcasses as possible.},

We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging , and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.},

Since 2007, ASF outbreaks have been ongoing in the Caucasus, Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries, causing severe economic losses for many pig farmers and pork producers. In addition, the number of ASF cases in wild boar populations has dramatically increased over the past few years. Evidence supports direct contact with infectious domestic pigs and wild boars, and consumption of contaminated feed, as the main transmission routes of ASF virus (ASFV) to domestic pigs. However, significant knowledge gaps highlight the urgent need for research to investigate the dynamics of indirect transmission via the environment, the minimal infective doses for contaminated feed ingestion, the probability of effective contacts between infectious wild boars and domestic pigs, the potential for recovered animals to become carriers and a reservoir for transmission, the potential virus persistence within wild boar populations and the influence of human behaviour for the spread of ASFV. This will provide an improved scientific basis to optimise current interventions and develop new tools and strategies to reduce the risk of ASFV transmission to domestic pigs.}

The second choice is the model representation (based on agents, entities, compartments or situations) used to describe the properties and behaviours of the objects in the studied population. Third, incomplete information about structure, transitions, signals, initial conditions or parameter values in the system under study must be addressed by alternative structures and statistical means. Fourth, the purpose of the study must be explicitly formulated in terms of the quantities used in the model. Fifth, irrespective of the choice of representation, there are three possible types of time handling: Event Scheduling, Time Slicing or Micro Time Slicing. Sixth, start and termination criteria for the simulation must be stated. The termination can be at a fixed end time or determined by a logical condition. Population models can thereby be classified within a unified framework, and population models of one type can be translated into another type in a consistent way. Understanding the pros and cons for different choices of model category, representation, time handling etc. will help the modeller to select the most appropriate type of model for a given purpose and population system under study. By understanding the rules for consistent population modelling, an appropriate model can be created in a systematic way and a number of pitfalls can be avoided.},

Wild boar is a main driver of the transmission and persistence of ASFV in the endemic infected countries in Europe. Some European countries free from ASF, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, have limited population sizes of wild boar, but have large swine productions. In these countries, the patterns of transmission and persistence of ASFV in the existing wild boar population, in case of introduction of ASFV, are unknown. It is important to get a better understanding of ASFV in these wild boar populations, in order to better manage the existing wild boar population and thereby minimize the risk of virus introduction and transmission to domestic pigs, in case of an ASFV incursion. We created an agent-based spatio-temporal model and simulated the transmission of ASFV within Danish wild boar populations, using actual landscape data. The model was run with 50 and 100 wild boar groups used as initial population sizes, respectively, either distributed across the southern part of the mainland (Jutland) or across both the southern and middle parts of Jutland, where wild boar groups are believed to exist. At first, the model was run without ASFV for 25 years to assess wild boar population dynamics in both regions. Thereafter, ASFV was added to the model 1\,year after initiation and run for up to another 4 years. The model predicted that wild boar populations may increase drastically over the next 25 years, if wild boar groups were distributed across both southern and middle Jutland and no mitigation actions were taken, while the population sizes will be restricted, if groups were distributed only across the southern part of Jutland. The density of the population is an important factor affecting the transmission and persistency of the disease.

To study the spread of African swine fever (ASF) within a pig unit and the impact of unit size on ASF spread, a simulation model was created. In the model, an animal can be in one of the following stages: susceptible, latent, subclinical, clinical, or recovered. Animals can be infectious during the subclinical stage and are fully infectious during the clinical stage. ASF virus (ASFV) infection through residues of dead animals in the slurries was also modeled in an exponentially fading-out pattern. Low and high transmission rates for ASFV were tested in the model. Robustness analysis was carried out in order to study the impact of uncertain parameters on model predictions. The results showed that the disease may fade out within the pig unit without a major outbreak. Furthermore, they showed that spread of ASFV is dependent on the infectiousness of subclinical animals and the residues of dead animals, the transmission rate of the virus, and importantly the unit size. Moreover, increasing the duration of the latent or the subclinical stages resulted in longer time to disease fade out. The proposed model is a simple and robust tool simulating the spread of ASFV within a pig house taking into account dynamics of ASFV spread and the unit size. The tool can be implemented in simulation models of ASFV spread between herds.},

Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

Such uncertainties, arising from the loss of precision induced by numerical calculation with limited time or hardware, are important for much contemporary science and industry. Within applications such as climate science and astrophysics, the need to make decisions on the basis of computations with large and complex data have led to a renewed focus on the management of numerical uncertainty. We describe how several seminal classic numerical methods can be interpreted naturally as probabilistic inference. We then show that the probabilistic view suggests new algorithms that can flexibly be adapted to suit application specifics, while delivering improved empirical performance. We provide concrete illustrations of the benefits of probabilistic numeric algorithms on real scientific problems from astrometry and astronomical imaging, while highlighting open problems with these new algorithms. Finally, we describe how probabilistic numerical methods provide a coherent framework for identifying the uncertainty in calculations performed with a combination of numerical algorithms (e.g. both numerical optimizers and differential equation solvers), potentially allowing the diagnosis (and control) of error sources in computations. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

These are particular concerns when modelling non-native and reintroduced species, when data have been collected within one geographical or ecological context but predictions are required for another, or when extending models to predict the consequences of environmental change (e.g., climate or land-use). We present an aspatial, probabilistic framework of hierarchical process models for predicting population growth even when data are sparse or of poor quality. Insight into the factors affecting population dynamics in real landscapes can be provided and Kullback-Leibler distances are used to compare the relative output of models. This flexible yet robust framework gives easily interpretable results, allowing managers as well as modellers to invalidate anomalous models and apply others to real-life scenarios. We illustrate the framework's power with a meta-analysis of European wild boar (Sus scrofa) data. We test hypotheses about the effect of geographic region, hunting and mast years on wild boar population growth, to build models of wild boar dynamics for the UK. The framework quantifies the importance of hunting pressure as a driver of population growth, and confirms that reproductive success is greatly decreased in poor mast years, suggesting that the key to predicting wild boar dynamics is to ascertain local hunting pressure and to better understand changing food availability. Geography had no significant effect, indicating that it is not a good proxy for modelling the impact of change in climate or land-use on wild boar populations at the European scale. We use the framework to predict population abundance 9 years after an isolated population of wild boar established in the UK; in a comparison with the only field data and two independent modelling exercises, our framework provides the most robust and informative results.

  abstract = {African Swine Fever (ASF) is viral infection which causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar. Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. Recent rapid propagation of the (ASF) from East to West of Europe encouraged us to prepare risk assessment for Poland. The early growth estimation can be easily done by matching incidence trajectory to the exponential function, resulting in the approximation of the force of infection. With these calculations the basic reproduction rate of the epidemic, the effective outbreaks detection and elimination times could be estimated. In regression mode, 380 Polish counties (poviats) have been analysed, where 18 (located in Northeast Poland) have been affected (until August 2017) for spatial propagation (risk assessment for future). Mathematical model has been applied by taking into account: swine amount significance, disease vectors (wild boards) significance. We use pseudogravitational models of short and longrange interactions referring to the socio-migratory behavior of wild boars and the pork production chain significance. Spatial modeling in a certain range of parameters proves the existence of a natural protective barrier within boarders of the Congress Poland. The spread of the disease to the Greater Poland should result in the accelerated outbreak of ASF production chain. In the preliminary setup, we perform regression analysis, network outbreak investigation, early epidemic growth estimation and simulate landscape-based propagation.},

  abstract = {Using GPS telemetry and ear tagging, we monitored wild boar sounder (a 2-year sow, a female yearling and eight piglets) captured in northern Slovenia. Five months after the capture, the sounder left its home range and first travelled 100 km west, to the three-border area between Slovenia, Austria and Italy, and from there toward southeast. The sow and three piglets were shot 2 months after start of dispersal 60 km from the capture site and in-between travelled at least 500 km. At least one piglet continued dispersal after the death of the sow, and the yearling split from the sounder during dispersal. This is the first documented case of long-distance dispersal of adult female wild boar with piglets. Several arguments suggest that long-distance dispersal of female wild boar is more common than previously reported in the literature. For wild boar and other species with predominant male dispersal, data on occasional far-dispersing females like presented here are important for understanding biology of species (e.g. metapopulations, rate of population expansion, local sex and age structure of population) and for management including control of diseases. \textcopyright{} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Denmark was considered not to have an established population of free-ranging wild boar. Today, sporadic observations of wild boar challenge that view. Due to its reservoir role for economic devastating swine diseases, wild boar represents a potential threat for Denmark's position as a large pig- and pork-exporting country. This study assessed the prospects of wild boar invasion in Denmark. Multi-source citizen science data of wild boar observations were integrated into a multi-modelling approach linking habitat suitability models with agent-based, spatially-explicit simulations. We tested whether the currently observed presence of wild boar is due to natural immigration across the Danish-German border, or whether it is more likely that wild boar escaped fenced premises. Five observational data sources served as evaluation data: (1) questionnaires sent to all 1625 registered owners of Danish farm land, located in the 60 parishes closest to the border, (2) an online questionnaire, (3) a mobile web-based GPS application, (4) reports in the media or by governmental agencies, and (5) geo-referenced locations of fenced wild boar populations. Data covering 2008-2013 included 195 observations of wild boar, including 16 observations of breeding sows. The data from the Danish Nature Agency and the mailed questionnaires were consistent regarding the location of wild boar observations, while data from the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, the media and the electronic questionnaires documented individual scattered observations in the rest of Jutland. Most observations were made in the region bordering Germany. It is uncertain whether the relatively few observations represent an established population. Model outcomes suggested that the origin of wild boar in about half of the area with sporadic observations of wild boar could be attributed to spatial expansions from a local Danish population near the border and consisting of wild boar originally of German origin. However, the other half, located distant to the border, were likely a result of animals escaping fenced premises inside the country. The approach serves as a template to assess the status of an invading species and improve the knowledge base for risk assessment and management decision.},

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease of swine that has been present in Sardinia since 1978. Soon after introduction of the disease, several control and eradication programmes were established with limited success. Some researchers attributed the persistence of the disease in central and eastern areas to certain socio-economic factors, the existence of some local and traditional farming practices (i.e., unregistered free-ranging pigs known as brado animals) and the high density of wild boar in the region. In the past, scarcity of swine data in Sardinia complicated the evaluation and study of ASF on the island. More complete, accurate and reliable information on pig farms has become available as a result of the most recent eradication programmes. Here, we perform statistical modelling based on these data and the known distribution of domestic pig and wild boar to identify the main risk factors that have caused ASF persistence in Sardinia. Our results categorized, identified and quantified nine significant risk factors, six of which have not been previously described. The most significant factors were the number of medium-sized farms, the presence of brado animals and the combination of estimated wild boar density and mean altitude above sea level. Based on these factors, we identified regions in eastern and central Sardinia to be at greatest risk of ASF persistence; these regions are also where the disease has traditionally been endemic. Based on these risk factors, we propose specific control measures aimed at mitigating such risks and eradicating ASF from the island.},

  abstract = {Bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) is generally thought of as a historical disease; however, it is still responsible for around 1000-3000 deaths each year worldwide. This paper expands the analysis of a model for bubonic plague that encompasses the disease dynamics in rat, flea and human populations. Some key variables of the deterministic model, including the force of infection to humans, are shown to be robust to changes in the basic parameters, although variation in the flea searching efficiency, and the movement rates of rats and fleas will be considered throughout the paper. The stochastic behaviour of the corresponding metapopulation model is discussed, with attention focused on the dynamics of rats and the force of infection at the local spatial scale. Short-lived local epidemics in rats govern the invasion of the disease and produce an irregular pattern of human cases similar to those observed. However, the endemic behaviour in a few rat subpopulations allows the disease to persist for many years. This spatial stochastic model is also used to identify the criteria for the spread to human populations in terms of the rat density Finally, the full stochastic model is reduced to the form of a probabilistic cellular automaton, which allows the analysis of a large number of replicated epidemics in large populations. This simplified model enables us to analyse the spatial properties of rat epidemics and the effects of movement rates, and also to test whether the emergent metapopulation behaviour is a property of the local dynamics rather than the precise details of the model.},

  abstract = {In many parts of Europe, wild boar Sus scrofa population increase, and thus, high densities and dispersal into new areas are accompanied by economic problems. Due to many factors like insufficient hunting strategies as well as underestimation of population densities and reproduction rates, harvest rates seem to be insufficient. Thus, we calculated mortality rates of several wild boar populations from 1998 to 2009, to show the efficiency of hunting within several studies distributed over eight European states. For calculating mortality rates, the daily probability of survival of radio telemetrically observed wild boar was analysed according to Mayfield (Wilson Bull 73:255-261, 1961) and with survival analysis in R for three age classes (0, 1, {$\geq$}2 years) and both sexes. The mortality rates of wild boar per annum, especially piglets, were comparably low (about 0.5 for piglets and similar for total population). About three third of all observed animals survived at least until the next period of reproduction. Mortality rates differed between some study areas, the sexes and age classes. The sex ratio of the shot piglets equals the sex ratio of captured piglets; there seems to be no sex-biased hunting in this age class, but in an older age. Shooting was the main cause of death; only very few animals died by natural causes, e.g. diseases. The comparative analysis of all studies reflects a low mortality of wild boar in highly productive populations. Our results certified the findings of several studies that predation, natural mortality, and road mortality have only small impact on wild boar populations, whereas especially, nutrition or hunting are mainly decisive. Assuming net reproduction rates of more than 200 \% according to literature data, our results indicate that harvest rates are not sufficient at our study sites. In all our studies, mortality rates and, thus, harvest rates are less than the assumed total net reproduction. Especially, the harvest rate of piglets seems to be insufficient. Thus, the population will increase further. High reproduction has to be counteracted by regulating mainly the reproductive animals. For regulating a population, combined and effective hunting methods have to be conducted to harvest at least the net reproduction. Thus, we recommend higher hunting rates of piglets (80 \% of the offspring should be harvested) and of adult females. Intensified hunting of piglets by drive hunts and at an early age as well as intensified single hunt on adult females might help regulating wild boar populations. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Increasing wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) population densities all over Europe cause severe economic problems. For understanding mechanisms of epidemics, the knowledge of dispersal is required. Thus, we investigated dispersal rates and distances with regard to sex and age of wild boar in southwestern Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. From 152 marked wild boar, 105 have been registered as dead, of which, 51\% were males and 49\% females. Fortyfive percent were shot as piglets, 41\% as yearlings, and 14\% as adults. The distance between capture site and site of death ranged between 184 m and 41.5 km. Piglets were shot closer to their capture site (mean distance 1 km) than older animals (mean 4 km), although this difference was only significant for males. In general, males tended to disperse further before being shot (3.8 km) than females (1.6 km). Only 3.8\% of all animals were shot at distances larger than 10 km. As most animals (84.6\%) were shot inside their natal home range, only a small proportion (15.4\%) did actually disperse (shot outside mothers home range), which is 32\% of all animals surviving to the age of yearlings. Of those dispersed animals, 25\% were females. The low dispersal rate is biased by female philopatry and allows actual dispersal only at very high population densities or in sparsely populated regions. In consideration for the low natural mortality proved by radiotagged animals, the harvest rate is lower than the net reproduction. We did not detect any sex-biased hunting. The dominating hunting method was single hunt at bait, although drive hunts are highly effective. However, hunting rates on piglets and females were too low for regulating the population. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

  abstract = {Viral disease persistence in species without a reservoir host is of importance for public health and disease management. But how can disease persistence be explained? We developed a spatially-explicit individual-based model that takes into account both ecological and viral traits as well as variable space to test disease persistence hypotheses under debate. We introduce a novel concept of modeling alternative disease courses at the individual level, causing transient infections or killing infected animals, with the lethally infected having a variable life-expectancy. We systematically distinguish between disease invasion and persistence. We use classical swine fever (CSF), an economically very important livestock disease in a social host, the wild boar, as a reference system to test and rank the persistence hypotheses under debate. Parameter values for host population demographics and CSF epidemiology reflect current knowledge. Sensitivity analysis of the model parameters revealed that the most important factor for disease persistence is a disease profile with mostly transient, i.e. surviving individuals requiring immunity, and some chronically, long-term infected animals. Immune individuals can constantly produce susceptible offspring, while some chronically infected individuals act as 'super spreaders' in time. Thus, variations in the course of the disease at the individual level are important factors determining persistence, which is usually not taken into account in the prominent measure of epidemiology, i.e. the basic reproductive number R-0, which reflects the 'reproductive potential' of the infected sub-population. We discuss our results with regard to the general issues of modeling epidemics and disease management issues.}

However, potential interactions between BP, WH, and DP, and the resulting potential circulation of infectious diseases have rarely been investigated in Africa to date. In order to understand the dynamics of such interactions and the potential influence of human behavior and husbandry practices on them, individual interviews (n = 233) and participatory rural appraisals (n = 11) were carried out among Ugandan pig farmers at the edge of Murchison Falls National Park, northern Uganda. In addition, as an example of possible implications of wild and DP interactions, non-linear multivariate analysis (multiple correspondence analyses) was used to investigate the potential association between the aforementioned factors (interactions and human behavior and practices) and farmer reported African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks. No direct interactions between wild pigs (WPs) and DP were reported in our study area. However, indirect interactions were described by 83 (35.6\%) of the participants and were identified to be more common at water sources during the dry season. Equally, eight (3.4\%) farmers declared exposing their DP to raw hunting leftovers of WPs. The exploratory analysis performed suggested possible associations between the farmer reported ASF outbreaks and indirect interactions, free-range housing systems, dry season, and having a WH burrow less than 3 km from the household. Our study was useful to gather local knowledge and to identify knowledge gaps about potential interactions between wild and DP in this area. This information could be useful to facilitate the design of future observational studies to better understand the potential transmission of pathogens between wild and DPs.},

  abstract = {Classical swine fever (CSF) is a severe multi-systemic disease that can affect both domestic pigs and wild boar. Past outbreaks in European wild boar involved high-virulent CSF virus (CSFV) strains and were mostly self-limiting. In these cases, morbidity and mortality rates were high in the affected regions. In contrast, endemic infections have been observed in several European wild boar populations in recent decades. Morbidity and mortality rates were much lower despite the fact that outbreaks were still detected via diseased or fallen animals. The virus strains involved were mostly classified as genotype 2.3 strains of moderate virulence causing age-dependent disease outcomes. The mechanisms leading to the establishment and perpetuation of endemicity are still not fully understood, but the factor " moderate virulence" seems to be of considerable importance.In this study, we aim to clarify whether the perception of declined 'CSF severity' could hypothetically reflect the adaptation of an initially high-virulent virus or whether this might be better explained as a misinterpretation of observations. A mechanistic eco-epidemiological model was employed to follow up a highly virulent strain of CSFV introduced into large connected wild boar populations. In the model, the virulence of the CSF virus is represented by case mortality and life expectancy after lethal infection. Allowing for small stochastic variation, these two characteristics of the virus are passed on with every new simulated infection that occurs.Model analysis revealed a decrease from high to moderate case mortality within a few years of simulated perpetuation of the virus. The resulting mortality corresponded to the level where the population average of the infectious period and the basic reproduction number of the disease were maximal. This shift in virulence was sufficient to prolong virus circulation considerably beyond the epidemic phase of the simulated outbreaks. Alternative mechanistic explanations for the decrease in disease severity in a CSF-affected wild boar population were evaluated in the light of the simulation experiments and the available epidemiological or virological evidence.In conclusion, the current virus isolates of subgroup 2.3 might be the ideally adapted variants of the CSF virus for long-term perpetuation in wildlife and indeed may have evolved (once) during past outbreaks in large populations. A repeated perception of a declining severity of disease pattern during the course of a CSF outbreak, however, favours the explanation based on monitoring and detection biases rather than repeated observation of selection against highly virulent virus during the time of virus perpetuation. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious lethal disease affecting domestic pigs and wild boar. For more than a decade ASF infection by genotype IIhas been circulating in Eurasian wild boar populations. It can be transmitted via direct animal contact or contact with contaminated carcasses in the environment. After several years of virus circulation in European wild boar population ongoing disease surveillance suggests regional fade-out of the infection. With this study an exit strategy based on routine surveillance procedures had to be informed and tested using an eco-epidemiological spatially explicit individual-based transmission model. The model simulations were performed on the geographical wild boar habitat map of Estonia and analysis referred to the administrative unit level of 2.500 km{$^2$} on average (LAU1 units). The analysis addressed the temporal profile of virus- and sero-positive animals in different age cohorts and the abundance of carcasses of animals succumbed to the disease in conjunction with regional virus-fade out. Alternative scenarios were tested for their impact on the duration of virus circulation in a limited area. Finally, different criteria to decide on the final status ASF circulation in a region were tested for their reliability by mimicking routine volumes of passive and active surveillance. The temporal profiles confirm the limited chance of a direct demonstration of virus absence. Therefore, the exit decision requires monitoring periods of several months to years. In order to keep efforts down a two-phase exit protocol does combine a longer phase with routine surveillance (the Screening phase) and a shorter (minimal) phase (the Confirmation phase) with increased surveillance (the maximum possible under field conditions). The two-phase exit strategy facilitates trade-off between invested surveillance efforts and total time to the final decision. Sensitivity of the exit decision is tested for uncertain aspects of ASF epidemiology and revealed performance decrease with increasing natural mortality, but improvement with increasing wild boar density and more distant translocations e.g. due to human activity. Survivors with extreme long-term infectiousness (years), if they would exist, do render the tested exit decision as unreliable. However, there is no evidence in support of such an assumption. Virus attenuation in terms of increased proportion of survivors (up to 20\% infected animals) and longer infectious periods (up to 4 weeks post infection) was congruent with the proposed exit strategy. The input to an exit decision by active surveillance i.e. testing of hunted animals, in particular for serology, was negligible.},

  abstract = {Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is considered an endemic disease in European wild boar populations. In view of the high economic impact of the introduction of the virus into domestic pig units, huge efforts are invested in the preventive control of CSF in wild boar populations. Recent European Community guidelines favour oral mass vaccination against CSF in wild boar populations. The guidelines are explicit on the temporal structure of the vaccination protocol, but little is known about the efficacy of different spatial application schemes, or how they relate to outbreak dynamics. We use a spatially explicit, individual-based wild boar model that represents the ecology of the hosts and the epidemiology of CSF, both on a regional scale and on the level of individual course of infection. We simulate adaptive spatial vaccination schemes accounting for the acute spread of an outbreak while using the temporal vaccination protocol proposed in the Community guidelines. Vaccination was found to be beneficial in a wide range of scenarios. We show that the short-term proactive component of a vaccination strategy is not only as decisive as short-term continuity, but also that it can outcompete alternative practices while being practically feasible. Furthermore, we show that under certain virus-host conditions vaccination might actually contribute to disease persistence in local populations.},

ASF was introduced into the southern Russian Federation in 2007 and is now reported to be spreading in populations of wild and domestic suids. An endemic situation in the local wild boar population would significantly complicate management of the disease in the livestock population. To date no sound method exists for identifying the characteristic pattern of an endemic situation, which describes infection persisting from generation to generation in the same population. To support urgent management decisions at the wildlife-livestock interface, a new algorithm was constructed to test the hypothesis of an endemic disease situation in wildlife on the basis of case reports. The approach described here uses spatial and temporal associations between observed diagnostic data to discriminate between endemic and non-endemic patterns of case occurrence. The algorithm was validated with data from an epidemiological simulation model and applied to ASF case data from southern Russia. Based on the algorithm and the diagnostic data available, the null hypothesis of an endemic situation of ASF in wild boar of the region was rejected.},

  abstract = {ASF is a devastating infectious disease of domestic pigs and wild boar, usually fatal. No vaccine exists to combat this virus. It does not affect humans nor does it affect any animal species other than members of the Suidae family. From the beginning of 2014 ASF has spread in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, mainly in the wild boar, causing very serious concerns. The European Commission requested EFSA to assess different wild boar management options taking into consideration its ecology in the Baltic States and Poland. Therefore, a simulation study was performed comparing control strategy alternatives using a spatio-temporally explicit individual-based model. The model was developed based on literature regarding wild boar ecology; ethology of the ASF virus recently circulating in Eastern Europe; wild boar density maps from the ASF affected regions and an expert consultation meeting. The model results did not reveal one single immediately effective control measure based on accepted wild boar management tools. Strategies using conventional wild boar management approaches -ban of feeding and targeted hunting of reproductive females -were found to become effective slowly over multiple generations of reproduction. Therefore, when applying the strategies, a width of 100-200km is required as buffer zone surrounding the area with ASF detections in order to compensate the forward spread till measures become effective. Massive population destruction (i.e. about 80\% of the population in the control area within 4 months with any available technique) or instantaneous removal of infectious carcasses could stop ASF spread already by limited buffer width of below 50km. The equal outcome is reasoned by the avoidance of infectious carcasses when the population was destroyed. Centred on the effective and immediate exclusion of wild boar contacts with infectious carcasses, hybrid strategies including reasonably intensified conventional hunting may suffice to stop ASF spread using a practical buffer width (about 50km) resp. time horizon (less than 3 years) for control while avoiding destructive measures.

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) infection is circulating in Eurasia since a decade within wild boar populations without a demonstrated vector host. Further the infection was recurrently translocated by spatio-temporal dynamics that is incompatible with wild boar movement characteristics. Management actions are required in areas affected by ASF. Control measures address areas with recent focal introduction and areas with ASF circulating several seasons or endemic occurrence. In view of acknowledged gaps in understanding ecology and epidemiology of ASF in Eurasian wild boar, mechanistic modelling was applied. A comparative assessment of alternative control efforts in the focal situations was performed, considering pre-emptive hunting, carcass detection and removal as well as fencing of selected zones. The individual-based model was applied to test whether inclusion of natural barriers would affect the similarity with ADNS notification data when simulating the landscape scale spread in the Baltics and Poland. The tendency of barriers to improve the explicit space-time predictions of the model could not be proven, more research is needed here. The comparative assessment revealed that in the focal scenario the increasing removal of carcasses will provide the greatest return on investment (given carcasses being involved in the transmission). Culling of the inner zones, usually with ASF detections, should be organised early if biosecurity standards could be guaranteed. Preventive hunting around the zones affected by ASF was an inevitable measure to cope with the risk of undetected release of the infection, although the measure alone was unable to terminate the spread. Fences assumed not wild boar proof contributed only marginally to the success but may act as demarcation of management zones in practice. The focal approach appears useful and practical to address ASF after local introductions.},

In the second stage we used a Population Viability Analysis (RAMAS/age), parameterized with published information on survival and fecundity of European Wild Boar populations, to calculate the number of animals required in a `release population' if it were to survive on average 50 years. At the two largest sites that we considered, a release population of 50 animals would be likely to produce a viable population. The study concluded that biologically, the reintroduction of the Wild Boar is possible. However, a complementary study examining both the environmental and the potential wider ecological and socio-economic impacts of Wild Boar will be required before reintroduction is seriously considered.},

  abstract = {The present wild boar Sus scrofa population in Sweden mainly originates from animals that have escaped from enclosures. At some locations wild boars have evidently been released deliberately. Whatever their origin, rapid increases in both number and distribution of free-ranging wild boars have occurred. As wild boars are considered exotic in the Swedish fauna, sportsmen very often provide supplemental food in varying degrees, partly to facilitate and secure hunting possibilities, partly to keep wild boars out of farmed crops.

  abstract = {The present wild boar Sus scrofa population in Sweden mainly originates from animals that have escaped from enclosures. At some locations wild boars have evidently been released deliberately. Whatever their origin, rapid increases in both number and distribution of free-ranging wild boars have occurred. As wild boars are considered exotic in the Swedish fauna, sportsmen very often provide supplemental food in varying degrees, partly to facilitate and secure hunting possibilities, partly to keep wild boars out of farmed crops. In this paper we describe wild boar activity behaviour and intend to show how wild boar adjust their activity behaviour under different ambient conditions.

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) severely threatens the swine industry worldwide, given its spread and the absence of an available licensed vaccine, and has caused severe economic losses. Its persistence in wild boar (WB), longer than in domestic pig farms, and the knowledge gaps in ASF epidemiology hinder ASF virus (ASFV) eradication. Even in areas where disease is effectively controlled and ASFV is no longer detected, declaring eradication is difficult as seropositive WBs may still be detected. The aim of this work was to estimate the main ASF epidemiological parameters specific for the north of Sardinia, Italy. The estimated basic (R0) and effective (Re) reproduction numbers demonstrate that the ASF epidemic is declining and under control with an R0 of 1.139 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.123\textendash 1.153) and Re of 0.802 (95\% CI = 0.612\textendash 0.992). In the last phases of an epidemic, these estimates are crucial tools for identifying the intensity of interventions required to definitively eradicate the disease. This approach is useful to understand if and when the detection of residual seropositive WB is no longer associated with any further ASFV circulation.},

  abstract = {Models of host\textendash pathogen interactions help to explain infection dynamics in wildlife populations and to predict and mitigate the risk of zoonotic spillover. Insights from models inherently depend on the way contacts between hosts are modelled, and crucially, how transmission scales with animal density. Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic disease and are among the most gregarious of all mammals. Their population structures can be highly heterogeneous, underpinned by ecological processes across different scales, complicating assumptions regarding the nature of contacts and transmission. Although models commonly parameterise transmission using metrics of total abundance, whether this is an ecologically representative approximation of host\textendash pathogen interactions is not routinely evaluated. We collected a 13-month dataset of tree-roosting Pteropus spp. from 2,522 spatially referenced trees across eight roosts to empirically evaluate the relationship between total roost abundance and tree-level measures of abundance and density\textemdash the scale most likely to be relevant for virus transmission. We also evaluate whether roost features at different scales (roost level, subplot level, tree level) are predictive of these local density dynamics. Roost-level features were not representative of tree-level abundance (bats per tree) or tree-level density (bats per m2 or m3), with roost-level models explaining minimal variation in tree-level measures. Total roost abundance itself was either not a significant predictor (tree-level 3D density) or only weakly predictive (tree-level abundance). This indicates that basic measures, such as total abundance of bats in a roost, may not provide adequate approximations for population dynamics at scales relevant for transmission, and that alternative measures are needed to compare transmission potential between roosts. From the best candidate models, the strongest predictor of local population structure was tree density within roosts, where roosts with low tree density had a higher abundance but lower density of bats (more spacing between bats) per tree. Together, these data highlight unpredictable and counterintuitive relationships between total abundance and local density. More nuanced modelling of transmission, spread and spillover from bats likely requires alternative approaches to integrating contact structure in host\textendash pathogen models, rather than simply modifying the transmission function.},

  abstract = {Tracking animal movements over time may fundamentally determine the success of disease control interventions. In commercial pig production growth stages determine animal transportation schedule, thus it generates time-varying contact networks showed to influence the dynamics of disease spread. In this study, we reconstructed pig networks of one Brazilian state from 2017 to 2018, comprising 351,519 movements and 48 million transported pigs. The static networks view did not capture time-respecting movement pathways. For this reason, we propose a time-dependent network approach. A susceptible-infected model was used to spread an epidemic over the pig network globally through the temporal between-farm networks, and locally by a stochastic model to account for within-farm dynamics. We propagated disease to calculate the cumulative contacts as a proxy of epidemic sizes and evaluate the impact of network-based disease control strategies in the absence of other intervention alternatives. The results show that targeting 1,000 farms ranked by degree would be sufficient and feasible to diminish disease spread considerably. Our modelling results indicated that independently from where initial infections were seeded (i.e. independent, commercial farms), the epidemic sizes and the number of farms needed to be targeted to effectively control disease spread were quite similar; indeed, this finding can be explained by the presence of contact among all pig operation types The proposed strategy limited the transmission the total number of secondarily infected farms to 29, over two simulated years. The identified 1,000 farms would benefit from enhanced biosecurity plans and improved targeted surveillance. Overall, the modelling framework provides a parsimonious solution for targeted disease surveillance when temporal movement data are available.},

  abstract = {A new stochastic and spatial model was developed to evaluate the potential spread of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) within- and between-farms, and considering the specific farm-to-farm contact network. Within-farm transmission was simulated using a modified SI model. Between-farm transmission was assumed to occur by direct contacts (i.e. animal movement) and indirect contacts (i.e. local spread, vehicle and person contacts) and considering the spatial location of farms. Control measures dictated by the European legislation (i.e. depopulation of infected farms, movement restriction, zoning, surveillance, contact tracing) were also implemented into the model. Model experimentation was performed using real data from Segovia, one of the provinces with highest density of pigs in Spain, and results were presented using the mean, 95\% probability intervals [95\% PI] and risk maps. The estimated mean [95\% PI] number of infected, quarantined and depopulated farms were 3 [1,17], 23 [0,76] and 115 [0,318], respectively. The duration of the epidemic was 63 [26,177] days and the most important way of transmission was associated with local spread (61.4\% of the infections). Results were consistent with the spread of previous CSFV introductions into the study region. The model and results presented here may be useful for the decision making process and for the improvement of the prevention and control programmes for CSFV. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This disease entered the European Union in 2014 and recently reached western Europe, with the first cases observed in Belgium in September 2018. Carcasses of ASF-infected wild boar play an important role in the spread and persistence of the virus in the environment. Thus, rapidly finding and removing carcasses is a crucial measure for effective ASF control. Using distribution modelling, we investigated whether the fine-scale distribution of ASF-infected animals can be predicted and support wild boar carcass searches. Our results suggest that ASF-infected wild boar selected deathbeds in cool and moist habitats; thus, deathbed choice was mostly influenced by topographic and water-dependent covariates. Furthermore, we show that in the case of an epidemic, it is important to quickly collect a minimum of 75\textendash 100 carcasses with exact locations to build a well-performing and efficient carcass distribution model. The proposed model provides an indication of where carcasses are most likely to be found and can be used as a guide to strategically allocate resources.},

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) has been spreading in the Eurasian continent for more than 10 years now. Although the course of ASF in domestic pigs and its negative economic impact on the pork industry are well-known, we still lack a quantitative assessment of the impact of ASF on wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations under natural conditions. Wild boar is not only a reservoir for ASF; it is also one of the key wildlife species affecting structure and functioning of ecosystems. Therefore, knowledge on how ASF affects wild boar populations is crucial to better predict ecosystem response and for the design of scientific-based wild boar management to control ASF. We used a long-term camera trap survey (2012-2017) from the Bia\l owieza Primeval Forest (BPF, Poland), where an ASF outbreak occurred in 2015, to investigate the impact of the disease on wild boar population dynamics under two contrasting management regimes (hunted vs. non-hunted). In the hunted part of BPF ("managed area"), hunting was drastically increased prior and after the first ASF case occurred (March 2015), whereas inside the National Park, hunting was not permitted ("unmanaged area," first detected case in June 2015). Using a random encounter model (REM), we showed that the density and abundance of wild boar dropped by 84 and 95\% within 1 year following ASF outbreak in the unmanaged and managed area, respectively. In the managed area, we showed that 11-22\% additional mortality could be attributed to hunting. Our study suggests that ASF-induced mortality, by far, outweighs hunting-induced mortality in causing wild boar population decline and shows that intensified hunting in newly ASF-infected areas does not achieve much greater reduction of population size than what is already caused by the ASF virus.},

Despite a growing literature on specific aspects of African swine fever transmission dynamics, it remains unclear which methods and approaches are most effective for controlling the disease during a crisis. As a consequence, an international modelling challenge was organized in which teams analyzed and responded to a stream of data from an in silico outbreak in the fictive country of Merry Island. In response to this outbreak, we developed a modelling approach that aimed to predict the evolution of the epidemic and evaluate the impact of potential control measures. Two independent models were developed: a stochastic mechanistic space\textendash time compartmental model for characterizing the dissemination of the virus among wild boar; and a deterministic probabilistic risk model for quantifying infection probabilities in domestic pig herds. The combined results of these two models provided valuable information for anticipating the main risks of dissemination and maintenance of the virus (speed and direction of African swine fever spread among wild boar populations, pig herds at greatest risk of infection, the size of the epidemic in the short and long terms), for evaluating the impact of different control measures and for providing specific recommendations concerning control interventions.},

  abstract = {Correspondance should be addressed to gnavaguerrero@student.tudelft.nl and philipp. Abstract: Modelling and simulation aim to reproduce the structure and imitate the behavior of real-life systems. For complex dynamic systems, System Dynamics (SD) and Agent-based (AB) modelling are two widely used modelling paradigms that prior to the early 2010's have traditionally been viewed as mutually exclusive alternatives. This literature review seeks to update the work of Scholl (2001) and Macal, (2010) by providing an overview of attempts to integrate SD and AB over the last ten years. First, the building blocks of both paradigms are presented. Second, their capabilities are contrasted, in order to explore how their integration can yield insights that cannot be generated with one methodology alone. Then, an overview is provided of recent work comparing the outcomes of both paradigms and specifying opportunities for integration. Finally, a critical reflection is presented. The literature review concludes that while paradigm emulation has contributed to expanding the applications of SD, it is the dynamic combination of the two approaches that has become the most promising research line. Integrating SD and AB, and even tools and methods from other disciplines, makes it possible to avoid their individual pitfalls and, hence, to exploit the full potential of their complementary characteristics, so as to provide a more complete representation of complex dynamic systems.

Although plant-based feed has been identified as a potential route for virus introduction onto swine farms, little is known about the risks for ASFV transmission in feed. We aimed to determine the minimum and median infectious doses of the Georgia 2007 strain of ASFV through oral exposure during natural drinking and feeding behaviors. The minimum infectious dose of ASFV in liquid was 100 50\% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), compared with 104 TCID50 in feed. The median infectious dose was 101.0 TCID50 for liquid and 106.8 TCID50 for feed. Our findings demonstrate that ASFV Georgia 2007 can easily be transmitted orally, although higher doses are required for infection in plant-based feed. These data provide important information that can be incorporated into risk models for ASFV transmission.},

Although the risk from feed is considered to be lower than several other pathways (e.g. contact with infected live animals and swill feeding), it cannot be ruled out that matrices assessed in this opinion pose a risk. Evidence on survival of ASFV in different matrices from literature and a public consultation was used in an Expert Knowledge Elicitation (EKE) on the possible contamination of products and traded or imported product volumes used on pig farms. The EKE results were used in a model that provided a risk-rank for each product's contamination likelihood (`q'), its trade or import volume from affected EU or Eurasian areas (N) and the modelled number of potentially infected pig farms (N~\texttimes ~q). The products ranking higher regardless of origin or destination were mash and pelleted compound feed, feed additives and cereals. Bedding/enrichment materials, hydrolysed proteins and blood products ranked lowest regardless of origin or destination. Empty vehicles ranked lower than compound feed but higher than non-compound feed or bedding/enrichment material. It is very likely (95\textendash 99\% certainty) that compound feed and cereals rank higher than feed materials, which rank higher than bedding/enrichment material and forage. As this is an assessment based on several parameters including the contamination and delivery to a pig farm, all of which have the same impact on the final ranking, risk managers should consider how the relative rank of each product may change with an effective storage period or a virus inactivation step.},

  abstract = {A surveillance program in which all cattle herds in Denmark are classified into Salmonella infection categories has been in place since 2002. Dairy herds were considered test negative and thus most likely free of infection if Salmonella antibody measurements were consistently low in bulk tank milk samples collected every 3 mo. Herds were considered test positive and thus most likely infected if the 4-quarter moving average bulk tank milk antibody concentration was high or if there was a large increase in the most recent measurement compared with the average value from the previous 3 samples. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for changing from test negative to positive, which was indicative of herds becoming infected from one quarter of the year to the next, and risk factors for changing from test positive to negative, which was indicative of herds recovering from infection between 2 consecutive quarters of the year. The Salmonella serotypes in question were Salmonella Dublin or other serotypes that cross-react with the Salmonella Dublin antigen in the ELISA (e.g., some Salmonella Typhimurium types). Two logistic regression models that accounted for repeated measurements at the herd level and controlled for herd size and regional effects were used. Data from 2003 was used for the analyses. A change from test negative to positive occurred in 2.0\% of the quarterly observations (n = 21,007) from test negative dairy herds. A change from test positive to negative occurred in 10.0\% of quarterly observations (n = 6,168) available from test positive dairy herds. The higher the number of test-positive neighbor herds in the previous year-quarter, the more likely herds were to become test positive for Salmonella. The number of purchased cattle from test-positive herds was also associated with changing from test negative to positive. The bigger the herd, the more likely it was to change from negative to test positive. The effect of herd size on recovery was less clear. Large herds consisting mainly of large breeds or having test-positive neighbors in a 2-km radius were less likely to change from test positive to negative, whereas the breed and neighbor factors were not found to be important for small herds. Organic production was associated with remaining test positive, but not with becoming test positive. The results emphasize the importance of external and internal biosecurity measures to control Salmonella infections. \textcopyright{} American Dairy Science Association, 2007.},

The evolution of density-dependent dispersal in a noisy spatial population model. \'A Oikos 115: 308 \'A320. It is well-known that dispersal is advantageous in many different ecological situations, e.g. to survive local catastrophes where populations live in spatially and temporally heterogeneous habitats. However, the key question, what kind of dispersal strategy is optimal in a particular situation, has remained unanswered. We studied the evolution of density-dependent dispersal in a coupled map lattice model, where the population dynamics are perturbed by external environmental noise. We used a very flexible dispersal function to enable evolution to select from practically all possible types of monotonous density-dependent dispersal functions. We treated the parameters of the dispersal function as continuously changing phenotypic traits. The evolutionary stable dispersal strategies were investigated by numerical simulations. We pointed out that irrespective of the cost of dispersal and the strength of environmental noise, this strategy leads to a very weak dispersal below a threshold density, and dispersal rate increases in an accelerating manner above this threshold. Decreasing the cost of dispersal increases the skewness of the population density distribution, while increasing the environmental noise causes more pronounced bimodality in this distribution. In case of positive temporal autocorrelation of the environmental noise, there is no dispersal below the threshold, and only low dispersal below it, on the other hand with negative autocorrelation practically all individual disperses above the threshold. We found our results to be in good concordance with empirical observations. A \textasciiacute. Kun},

These matrices include uncooked pig meat, processed pig-derived products, feed, matrices contaminated with the virus and blood-feeding invertebrates. Knowledge gaps still exist, and both field studies and laboratory research are needed to enhance understanding of the risks for ASFV introductions, especially via virus-contaminated materials, including bedding and feed, and via blood-feeding, flying insects. Knowledge obtained from such studies can be applied to epidemiological risk assessments for the different transmission routes. Such assessments can be utilized to help predict the most effective biosecurity and control strategies.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of African swine fever virus (ASFV) into the Baltic states and Poland in 2014, the disease has continued to spread within these regions. In 2017, the virus spread further west and the first cases of disease were reported in the Czech Republic and Romania, in wild boar and domestic pigs, respectively. To control further spread, knowledge of different modes of transmission, including indirect transmission via a contaminated environment, is crucial. Up until now, such an indirect mode of transmission has not been demonstrated. In this study, transmission via an environment contaminated with excretions from ASFV-infected pigs was investigated. Following euthanasia of pigs that were infected with an isolate of ASFV from Poland (POL/2015/Podlaskie/Lindholm), healthy pigs were introduced into the pens, in which the ASFV-infected pigs had been housed. Introduction was performed at 1, 3, 5 or 7~days, following euthanasia of the infected pig groups. Pigs, that were introduced into the contaminated environment after 1~day, developed clinical disease within 1~week, and both ASFV DNA and infectious virus were isolated from their blood. However, pigs introduced into the contaminated pens after 3, 5 or 7~days did not develop any signs of ASFV infection and no viral DNA was detected in blood samples obtained from these pigs within the following 3~weeks. Thus, it was shown that exposure of pigs to an environment contaminated with ASFV can result in infection. However, the time window for transmissibility of ASFV seems very limited, and, within our experimental system, there appears to be a rapid decrease in the infectivity of ASFV in the environment.}

  abstract = {In 2014, African swine fever virus (ASFV) was introduced into the Baltic states and Poland. Since then, the disease has continued to spread within these regions, and recently, cases were reported in the Czech Republic and Romania. Currently, there is an increasing risk of ASFV introduction into Western Europe. Hence, there is an urgent need to assess current contingency plans. For this purpose, knowledge of modes-of-transmission and clinical outcome in pigs infected with new European ASFV strains is needed. In the present study, two experiments were conducted in pigs using an isolate of ASFV from Poland (designated here POL/2015/Podlaskie/Lindholm). In both studies, pigs were inoculated intranasally with the virus and contact pigs were exposed to the experimentally infected pigs, either directly (contact within and between pens) or by air. Pigs exposed to the virus by intranasal inoculation, by direct contact to infected animals and by aerosol developed acute disease characterized by viremia, fever and depression. Infectious virus was first detected in blood obtained from the inoculated pigs and then sequentially among the within-pen, between-pen and air-contact pigs. ASFV DNA and occasionally infectious virus was found in nasal-, oral-, and rectal swabs obtained from the pigs, and ASFV DNA was detected in air samples. No anti-ASFV antibodies were detected in sera. In conclusion, the study shows that the currently circulating strain of ASFV can be efficiently transmitted via direct contact and by aerosols. Also, the results provide quantitative transmission parameters and knowledge of infection stages in pigs infected with this ASFV.},

  abstract = {Background: The emergence in 2014 and persistence of African Swine Fever (ASF) in Lithuania has been linked to infected wild boar movement and close contact with the carcasses of other infected wild boars. Over time the number of reported cases of ASF in wild boars gradually increased, but no detailed epidemiological data has been available. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine ASF virus prevalence in wild boars and domestic pigs during the 2014-2017 period and further explore the current geographical distribution of the virus. Results: Our study results show that ASF virus prevalence in hunted wild boars using PCR analysis increased from 0.83\% (95\% CI 0.69-0.98) to 2.27\% (95\% CI 2.05-2.48) from 2014 to 2016 respectively. However, there was a dramatic jump in the number of ASF positive wild boars cases in 2017 resulting in prevalence of 12.39\% (95\% CI 11.91-12.86) (p {$<$} 0.05). The average prevalence of ASF-specific antibodies in wild boar population during years 2014-2017 was 0.45\% (95\% CI 0.39-0.51) based on ELISA test results. Prevalence of ASF virus in domestic pigs ranged from 0.24\% (95\% CI 0.17\% - 0.32) in 2015 to 2.74\% (95\% CI 2.33\% - 3.15) in 2017. The average seasonal prevalence of ASF virus in pigs was statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.05) and ranged from 0\% in spring to 3.68\% (95\% CI 3.32-4.05) in summer. Correlation between the pig density and number of recorded pig ASF cases in affected regions was only found in 2017 (R = 0.78, p {$<$} 0.05). No correlation was detected between the wild boar density and number of recorded pig or wild boar ASF - positive cases. Conclusions: This study provides the first results of ASF virus prevalence changes in Lithuania during the 2014-2017. The overall results confirm the relatively high prevalence of ASF virus in wild boar that was gradually increasing from 2014 to 2017. In the last year of study, the number of ASF positive cases in both domestic pigs and wild boars had unexpectedly increased several times. A better understanding of current status of the disease will enable better control and prevent further spread of ASF virus in Western Europe.}

With the introduction of genotype II strains into the European Union in 2014, the disease has apparently found a fertile breeding ground in the abundant wild boar population. Upon infection with highly virulent ASF virus (ASFV), a haemorrhagic fever like illness with high lethality is seen in na\"ive domestic pigs and wild boar. Despite intensive research, virulence factors, host-virus interactions and pathogenesis are still far from being understood, and neither vaccines nor treatment exist. However, to better understand the disease, and to work towards a safe and efficacious vaccine, this information is needed. The presented review targets the knowledge gained over the last five years with regard to ASF pathogenesis in the broader sense but with a focus on the pandemic genotype II strains. In this way, it is designed as an update and supplement to existing review articles on the same topic.},

  abstract = {The wild boar is an important crop raider as well as a reservoir and agent of spread of swine diseases. Due to increasing densities and expanding ranges worldwide, the related economic losses in livestock and agricultural sectors are significant and on the rise. Its management and control would strongly benefit from accurate and detailed spatial information on species distribution and abundance, which are often available only for small areas. Data are commonly available at aggregated administrative units with little or no information about the distribution of the species within the unit. In this paper, a four-step geostatistical downscaling approach is presented and used to disaggregate wild boar population density statistics from administrative units of different shape and size (polygons) to 5 km resolution raster maps by incorporating auxiliary fine scale environmental variables. 1) First a stratification method was used to define homogeneous bioclimatic regions for the analysis; 2) Under a geostatistical framework, the wild boar densities at administrative units, i.e. subnational areas, were decomposed into trend and residual components for each bioclimatic region. Quantitative relationships between wild boar data and environmental variables were estimated through multiple regression and used to derive trend components at 5 km spatial resolution. Next, the residual components (i.e., the differences between the trend components and the original wild boar data at administrative units) were downscaled at 5 km resolution using area-to-point kriging. The trend and residual components obtained at 5 km resolution were finally added to generate fine scale wild boar estimates for each bioclimatic region. 3) These maps were then mosaicked to produce a final output map of predicted wild boar densities across most of Eurasia. 4) Model accuracy was assessed at each different step using input as well as independent data.

  abstract = {Host abundance and landscape structure often interact to shape spatial patterns of many wildlife diseases. Emergence, spread, and persistence of African swine fever (ASF) among wild boar in eastern Europe has raised questions on the factors underlying ASF dynamics in this novel host-pathogen system. This work identifies drivers of ASF occurrence in natural wild boar population. We evaluated factors shaping the probability of ASF-postitive wild boar during the first three years (2014-2016) of the ASF epidemic in Poland. We expected to observe positive effects of wild boar density, proportion of forested area, human activity, and proximity to previous infections on ASF case probability. We tested these predictions using the infection status of 830 wild boar samples and generalized mixed-effects models. The probability of ASF case increased from 3 to 20\% as population density rose from 0.4 to 2 ind./km2. The positive effect of population density on ASF case probability was stronger at locations near previous ASF incidents. ASF was more likely to occur in forested areas, with the probability of detecting an ASF positive sample rising from 2 to 11\% as forest cover around the sample increased from 0.5 to 100\%. This pattern was consistent at both low and high wild boar densities. Indicators of human activity were poor predictors of ASF occurrence. Disease control efforts, such as culling and carcass search, should be focused on high-density populations where chances of detecting and eliminating ASF-positive wild boar are higher. The intensity of control measures should decrease with distance from the infected area to match the observed spatial pattern of ASF case probability. Woodlands represent areas of the highest risk of ASF case occurrence. Distribution and connectivity of suitable habitats over the landscape can be used to prioritize disease-management actions.},

  abstract = {556 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE | VOL 6 | JUNE 2016 | www.nature.com/natureclimatechange M anaging energy demand, including patterns of consumer energy technology adoption and consumption, is important for achieving local, regional and global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 1-4. Policy options for managing climate change increasingly focus on using consumer demand as a lever through which to achieve policy goals 2,5 , for example, by providing options for consumers to use alternative energy sources. Consumers can now invest in technologies that allow them to reduce their demand for energy supplied by traditional utilities, or even become energy producers themselves. Such 'demand side' technologies include rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), home energy management systems, and new battery storage technologies. These technologies can make energy infrastructure more reliable, efficient and less polluting 6. Successfully leveraging such opportunities requires a better understanding of how consumer behaviour shapes the demand side of the global energy system. We need to understand why people use energy the way they do, how individuals respond to information about the costs and benefits of energy choices, and how energy policies or programmes affect behaviour at the individual and aggregate levels. Answering these questions is crucial to developing policies and programmes that facilitate the development of a global energy system that enhances human wellbeing and is less dependent on fossil fuels, and thus helps to mitigate global climate change. At the same time, conventional tools used to understand these systems, such as system dynamic models, do not cope well with the complexity of consumer energy behaviours 1,3,7. In this Perspective, we explore the usefulness of agent-based modelling (ABM) to represent the complexities of consumer behaviour in ways that improve our understanding of the demand side of energy systems. In particular, we present a simple framework that highlights how practical agent-based models can be built for theory-testing and predictive modelling of the demand side of energy. Furthermore, we critically review the relevant ABM literature through the lens of this framework in order to identify how ABM can improve both ex ante and ex post policy design and evaluation. ABM has the potential to integrate features of both applied and theoretical work, and thus exists in what is sometimes referred Strategies to mitigate global climate change should be grounded in a rigorous understanding of energy systems, particularly the factors that drive energy demand. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a powerful tool for representing the complexities of energy demand, such as social interactions and spatial constraints. Unlike other approaches for modelling energy demand, ABM is not limited to studying perfectly rational agents or to abstracting micro details into system-level equations. Instead, ABM provides the ability to represent behaviours of energy consumers-such as individual households-using a range of theories, and to examine how the interaction of heterogeneous agents at the micro-level produces macro outcomes of importance to the global climate, such as the adoption of low-carbon behaviours and technologies over space and time. We provide an overview of ABM work in the area of consumer energy choices, with a focus on identifying specific ways in which ABM can improve understanding of both fundamental scientific and applied aspects of the demand side of energy to aid the design of better policies and programmes. Future research needs for improving the practice of ABM to better understand energy demand are also discussed. to as 'Pasteur's quadrant' of use-inspired basic research 8. Thus ABM could contribute substantially to a science of sustainability that not only develops theories of coupled human and natural systems, but also helps to design strategies that will promote more sustainable energy behaviours at a large scale 9,10. In the following sections, we first examine the limitations of key non-ABM approaches to modelling the demand side of energy. We then present a framework describing the essential features of ABM as it is used in the modelling of complex energy systems, and the potential of ABM work to enhance our understanding of consumer energy demand. Next we examine how ABM is used in practice, particularly how this approach allows researchers to not only calibrate models and predict or explore future trends, but also develop more refined theories of the factors that underlie and influence energy demand. These theoretical insights are useful in that they suggest strategies to promote more sustainable energy behaviours. We conclude with recommendations for ABM researchers to improve current modelling practice. Finally, we highlight important but understudied questions that ABM can be used to address. Non-ABM approaches Models of energy systems generally include detailed representations of energy supply with relatively less attention paid to the complexities of consumer demand 1,3,11,12. Infrastructure planning by electric utilities offers an example of the limitations posed by extant supply-side models 4. In these models, energy demand is often extrapolated from past behaviour, controlling for projected changes in demo-graphics and economic growth. The arrival of distributed generation technologies, such as solar PV, portends a major technological and business-model shift that is not captured in these simple extrapola-tions 4. That is because demand-side technologies are rapidly making consumer behaviour a much more dynamic and important component of the electricity system than in the past. Consumer evaluation and adoption of energy technologies includes not only monetary factors, such as price, expectations about performance, and information search costs 13 , but also non-monetary factors, such as social norms, past experience, perceptions of quality, and trust-based information networks 1,14,15. \textcopyright{} 2 0 1 6 M a c m i l l a n P u b l i s h e r s L i m i t e d.

In this paper we consider those situations in which a map of a spatial pattern has been produced at some cost and we wish to extract the maximum possible information. We review the stochastic models which have been proposed for spatial point patterns and discuss methods by which the fit of such a model can be tested. Certain models are shown to be the equilibrium distributions of spatial-temporal stochastic processes. The theory is illustrated by several case studies.},

  abstract = {1 Geographic gradients in population dynamics may occur because of spatial variation in resources that affect the deterministic components of the dynamics (i.e. carrying capacity, the specific growth rate at small densities or the strength of density regulation) or because of spatial variation in the effects of environmental stochasticity. To evaluate these, we used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate parameters characterizing deterministic components and stochastic influences on population dynamics of eight species of ducks (mallard, northern pintail, blue-winged teal, gadwall, northern shoveler, American wigeon, canvasback and redhead (Anas platyrhynchos, A. acuta, A. discors, A. strepera, A. clypeata, A. americana, Aythya valisineria and Ay. americana, respectively) breeding in the North American prairies, and then tested whether these parameters varied latitudinally. 2 We also examined the influence of temporal variation in the availability of wetlands, spring temperature and winter precipitation on population dynamics to determine whether geographical gradients in population dynamics were related to large-scale variation in environmental effects. Population variability, as measured by the variance of the population fluctuations around the carrying capacity K, decreased with latitude for all species except canvasback. This decrease in population variability was caused by a combination of latitudinal gradients in the strength of density dependence, carrying capacity and process variance, for which details varied by species. 3 The effects of environmental covariates on population dynamics also varied latitudinally, particularly for mallard, northern pintail and northern shoveler. However, the proportion of the process variance explained by environmental covariates, with the exception of mallard, tended to be small. 4 Thus, geographical gradients in population dynamics of prairie ducks resulted from latitudinal gradients in both deterministic and stochastic components, and were likely influenced by spatial differences in the distribution of wetland types and shapes, agricultural practices and dispersal processes. 5 These results suggest that future management of these species could be improved by implementing harvest models that account explicitly for spatial variation in density effects and environmental stochasticity on population abundance.},

  abstract = {African Swine Fever (ASF) has been slowly but steadily increasing its endemic range throughout Europe, posing an imminent risk to the pig industry. ASF transmission among wild boar occurs mainly through wild boar population movements, hence wild boar presence and density are important risk factors for introducing, maintaining, and spreading the disease. The understanding of wild boar population dynamics and their role in ASF transmission and persistence remains limited. It is crucial to gain knowledge in this area to improve wildlife management while minimizing the risks for ASF introduction and spread. We adapted an individual-based spatio-temporal stochastic model developed by Halasa et al. (2019) and tailored it to two regions in France. The model assessed yearly hunting activity, the carcass persistence seasonality, and the specific landscape characteristics of the Franco-Belgian border region and the Pyr\'en\'ees-Atlantiques department. Following the establishment of local population dynamics through preliminary runs of the model, the model was run 100 iterations over 8 years in the two study areas where ASF was randomly seeded after the 2nd year of simulation. For each scenario, the model was initiated with 500 wild boar groups randomly spread across the study areas. Hunting activities were included and excluded to assess the impact on population growth and ASF spread. Results showed an ever-growing wild boar population for all scenarios, which was balanced when hunting activities were included. When introducing ASF, the wild boar populations were dramatically impacted in both areas with a decrease of 63 \% of the population at the Franco-Belgian border and 86 \% in the Pyr\'en\'ees-Atlantiques department. Habitat fragmentation and landscape connectivity were highlighted as important factors shaping ASF propagation. The Franco-Belgian border, which had the most fragmented habitat with unsuitable areas for wild boars, was shown to limit wild boar movements, reducing the probability, and spread of ASF across the landscape. The lack of connectivity was reflected in a less effective transmission and lower number of infected groups (406 versus 467). In contrast, the epidemic duration was lengthened in the fragmented habitat compared to the homogenous area (2.6 years vs 1.6 years). This study provided information on defining and implementing control measures in case of an ASF incursion, since delimitation of the area via fences artificially induces landscape fragmentation, which is important for controlling ASF outbreaks.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}After the re-introduction of African swine fever virus (ASFV) genotype II isolates into Georgia in 2007, the disease spread from Eastern to Western Europe and then jumped first up to Mongolian borders and later into China in August 2018, spreading out of control and reaching different countries of Southeast Asia in 2019. From the initial incursion, along with domestic pigs, wild boar displayed a high susceptibility to ASFV and disease development. The disease established self-sustaining cycles within the wild boar population, a key fact that helped its spread and that pointed to the wild boar population as a substantial reservoir in Europe and probably also in Asia, which may hinder eradication and serve as the source for further geographic expansion. The present review gathers the most relevant information available regarding infection dynamics, disease pathogenesis and immune response that experimental infections with different ASFV isolates belonging to genotype I and II in wild boar and feral pigs have generated. Knowledge gaps in areas such as disease pathogenesis and immune response highlights the importance of focusing future studies on unravelling the early mechanisms of virus-cell interaction and innate and/or adaptive immune responses, knowledge that will contribute to the development of efficacious treatments/vaccines against ASFV.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of African swine fever (ASF) into Georgia in 2007, the disease has been spreading in an unprecedented way. Many countries that are still free from the disease fear the emergence of ASF in their territory either in domestic pigs or in wild boar. In the past, ASF was often described as being a highly contagious disease with mortality often up to 100\%. However, the belief that the disease might enter a na\&iuml;ve population and rapidly affect the entire susceptible population needs to be critically reviewed. The current ASF epidemic in wild boar, but also the course of ASF within outbreaks in domestic pig holdings, suggest a constant, but relatively slow spread. Moreover, the results of several experimental and field studies support the impression that the spread of ASF is not always fast. ASF spread and its speed depend on various factors concerning the host, the virus, and also the environment. Many of these factors and their effects are not fully understood. For this review, we collated published information regarding the spreading speed of ASF and the factors that are deemed to influence the speed of ASF spread and tried to clarify some issues and open questions in this respect.},

  abstract = {For species in which reproductive success is more variable in one sex than the other, the Trivers and Willard model (TWM) predicts that females are able to adjust their offspring sex ratio. High-quality mothers should provide greater investment to one sex than the other. Previous tests of the TWM have been inconsistent, and whether the TWM applies to species with several offspring per litter is unclear due to possible trade-offs between size, number, and sex of the offspring. Williams' model (WM) accounts for confounding effects of these trade-offs on sex ratio variation. Lastly, the "extrinsic modification hypothesis" predicts changes in offspring sex ratio in relation to climatic conditions and population density. Using wild boar as a model, we tested 1) whether the WM fitted observed sex ratio variation and 2) whether sex ratio variations were related to maternal attributes (test of the TWM) and/or to resource availability (test of the extrinsic modification hypothesis). Females adjusted their litter size rather than their litter composition, so that the WM was not supported. Likewise, changes in resource availability did not influence the fetal sex ratio, so that the extrinsic modification hypothesis was not supported. The fetal sex ratio was negatively related to increasing litter size, providing some support for the TWM. Sex ratio was male biased for litter sizes up to 6 and then became female biased in larger litters. Our results provide the first case study showing marked changes in sex ratio in relation to litter size in a large mammal. \textcopyright{} The Author 2007.

  abstract = {Given the proximity of African swine fever (ASF) to the U.S., there is an urgent need to better understand the possible dissemination pathways of the virus within the U.S. swine industry and to evaluate mitigation strategies. Here, we extended PigSpread, a farm-level spatially-explicit stochastic compartmental transmission model incorporating six transmission routes including between-farm swine movements, vehicle movements, and local spread, to model the dissemination of ASF. We then examined the effectiveness of control and eradication actions similar to the ASF national response plan. The average number of secondary infections during the first 60 days of the outbreak was 49 finisher farms, 17 nursery farms, 5 sow farms, and less than one farm in other production types. The between-farm movements of swine were the predominant route of ASF transmission with an average contribution of 71.1\%, while local spread and movement of vehicles were less critical with average contributions of 14.6\% and 14.4\%. We demonstrated that the combination of quarantine, depopulation, movement restrictions, contact tracing, and enhanced surveillance, was the most effective mitigation strategy, resulting in an average reduction of 79.0\% of secondary cases by day 140 of the outbreak. Implementing these control and eradication actions led to a median of 495,619 depopulated animals, 357,789 diagnostic tests, and 54,522 movement permits. Our results suggest that the successful elimination of an ASF outbreak is likely to require the deployment of all control actions listed in the ASF national response plan for more than 140 days, as well as estimating the resources needed for depopulation, testing, and movement permits under these controls.},

  abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) has been causing multiple outbreaks in Russia, Poland and the Baltic countries in recent years and is currently spreading westwards throughout Europe and eastwards into China, with cases occurring in wild boar and domestic pigs. Curtailing further spread of ASF requires full understanding of the transmission pathways of the disease. Wild boars have been implicated as a potential reservoir for the disease and one of the main modes of transmission within Europe. We developed a spatially explicit model to estimate the risk of infection with ASF in boar and pigs due to the natural movement of wild boar that is applicable across the whole of Europe. We demonstrate the model by using it to predict the probability that early cases of ASF in Poland were caused by wild boar dispersion. The risk of infection in 2015 is computed due to wild boar cases in Poland in 2014, compared against the reported cases in 2015 and then the procedure is repeated for 2015-2016. We find that long- and medium-distance spread of ASF (i.e. \&gt;30km) is very unlikely to have occurred due to boar dispersal, due in part to the generally short distances boar will travel (\&lt;20km on average). We also predict what the relative success of different control strategies would have been in 2015, if they were implemented in 2014. Results suggest that hunting of boar reduces the number of new cases, but a larger region is at risk of ASF compared to no control measure. Alternatively, introducing boar-proof fencing reduces the size of the region at risk in 2015, but not the total number of cases. Overall, our model suggests wild boar movement is only responsible for local transmission of disease, thus other pathways are more dominant in medium and long distance spread of the disease.},

Overall yearly mortality was {$>$}50\% for all sex and age-classes. Low survival was mostly due to high hunting mortality, a wild boar had a {$>$}40\% of chance of being harvested annually, and this risk was as high as 70\% for adult males. Natural mortality rates of wild boar were similar for males and females (approx. 0.15). These rates were comparable to rates typical of male ungulates but high for female ungulates. Wild boar survival did not vary across sex and age-classes. Despite high hunting mortality, we did not detect evidence of compensatory mortality. Whereas natural mortality for males was constant over time, female mortality varied annually, independent of fluctuations in mast availability. Female wild boar survival patterns differed from those reported in other ungulates, with high and variable natural mortality. In other ungulates, natural mortality is typically low and stable across a wide range of environmental conditions. These differences may partly reflect high litter sizes for wild boar, which carries high energetic costs. High hunting mortality may induce a high investment of females in reproduction early in life, at the detriment to survival. Despite high hunting mortality, the study population increased. Effective population control of wild boar should target a high harvest rate of piglets and reproductive females.},

Mast seeding responds positively to warm spring temperatures and is therefore expected to increase under global warming. We investigated the potential effects of changes in oak mast seeding on wild boar population dynamics, a widespread and abundant consumer species. Using long-term monitoring data, we showed that abundant acorn production enhances the proportion of breeding females. With a body-mass-structured population model and a fixed hunting rate of 0.424, we showed that high acorn production over time would lead to an average wild boar population growth rate of 1.197 whereas non-acorn production would lead to a stable population. Finally, using climate projections and a mechanistic model linking weather data to oak reproduction, we predicted that mast seeding frequency might increase over the next century, which would lead to increase in both wild boar population size and the magnitude of its temporal variation. Our study provides rare evidence that some species could greatly benefit from global warming thanks to higher food availability and therefore highlights the importance of investigating the cascading effects of changing weather conditions on the dynamics of wild animal populations to reliably assess the effects of climate change.},

Relative population density was estimated from root counts, and dispersal rates were estimated through capture/mark/recapture. In this study, population density and dispersal behaviour were not strongly correlated. In both sexes, dispersal distance was not correlated with population density, but the proportion of individuals dispersing tended to be negatively correlated with density. The correlations are, however, sensitive to changes in the home range diameter used in the analysis and the results should be interpreted with this in mind.},

  abstract = {In order to estimate age at natal dispersal and dispersal distance, wild boars Sus scrofa were studied in Sweden by use of mark-recapture and telemetry. To describe the average natal dispersal in the population, we applied a sigmoid regression model to analyse the age specific distance to the natal site. We used the first and second order derivatives of the model to determine at which average age dispersal begins, reaches its maximum rate and ceases. The average dispersal distance was estimated by the maximum value of the model. Using this method, we reached the conclusion that male wild boars begin to disperse at the age of 10 months, reach their maximum dispersal rate at the age of 13 months, and that dispersal ceases at the age of 16 months. At that age, they have dispersed 16.6 km from their natal sites. For females, the corresponding ages were 7, 9 and 11 months, with a dispersal distance of 4.5 km. The results follow the prevalent opinion on natal dispersal in polygynous mammals. Dispersal distances are generally short with a negative exponential probability distribution. Dispersal reaches its maximum rate during the age at which sexual maturity is occurring, and males disperse longer distances than females.},

  abstract = {Stochastic simulations are one of the cornerstones of the analysis of dynamical processes on complex networks, and are often the only accessible way to explore their behavior. The development of fast algorithms is paramount to allow large-scale simulations. The Gillespie algorithm can be used for fast simulation of stochastic processes, and variants of it have been applied to simulate dynamical processes on static networks. However, its adaptation to temporal networks remains non-trivial. We here present a temporal Gillespie algorithm that solves this problem. Our method is applicable to general Poisson (constant-rate) processes on temporal networks, stochastically exact, and up to multiple orders of magnitude faster than traditional simulation schemes based on rejection sampling. We also show how it can be extended to simulate non-Markovian processes. The algorithm is easily applicable in practice, and as an illustration we detail how to simulate both Poissonian and non-Markovian models of epidemic spreading. Namely, we provide pseudocode and its implementation in C++ for simulating the paradigmatic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with non-constant recovery rates. For empirical networks, the temporal Gillespie algorithm is here typically from 10 to 100 times faster than rejection sampling.},

  abstract = {The Danish government and cattle industry instituted a Salmonella surveillance program in October 2002 to help reduce Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Dublin (S. Dublin) infections. All dairy herds are tested by measuring antibodies in bulk tank milk at 3-month intervals. The program is based on a well-established ELISA, but the overall test program accuracy and misclassification was not previously investigated. We developed a model to simulate repeated bulk tank milk antibody measurements for dairy herds conditional on true infection status. The distributions of bulk tank milk antibody measurements for infected and noninfected herds were determined from field study data. Herd infection was defined as having either {$\geq$}1 Salmonella culture-positive fecal sample or {$\geq$}5\% within-herd prevalence based on antibody measurements in serum or milk from individual animals. No distinction was made between Dublin and other Salmonella serotypes which cross-react in the ELISA. The simulation model was used to estimate the accuracy of herd classification for true herd-level prevalence values ranging from 0.02 to 0.5. Test program sensitivity was 0.95 across the range of prevalence values evaluated. Specificity was inversely related to prevalence and ranged from 0.83 to 0.98. For a true herd-level infection prevalence of 15\%, the estimate for specificity (Sp) was 0.96. Also at the 15\% herd-level prevalence, approximately 99\% of herds classified as negative in the program would be truly noninfected and 80\% of herds classified as positive would be infected. The predictive values were consistent with the primary goal of the surveillance program which was to have confidence that herds classified negative would be free of Salmonella infection. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the 19 different areas the calculated prevalence ranged from 0.01 to 0.41. Totally 3,697 GR-scores were given. The mean GR-scores in the areas ranged from 0.0 to 6.5. Higher GR-scores were found in herds changing to seropositive status compared with herds seronegative throughout the study period.

For example, rooting by wild boars is a recurrent disturbance regime, which varies in frequency and extent. Rooting by wild boars (Sus scrofa L.) in south-central Sweden was therefore studied by censusing three times per year during 1992-1995 along fixed transects in the Tullgarn Nature Reserve. Significant differences were found in soil surface area being rooted by wild boar between year, season, habitat type and soil category. The amount of surface being rooted varied between 2.4 and 14.2 ha on 226 ha censused. The rooted surface in relation to the ground available was higher in deciduous compared to coniferous forests and grassland. Furthermore, the rooted surface in relation to available ground to root was much higher in damp soil than in dry soil. Mesic soil was used according to availability. Rooted patches showed large variation in size between year, season, habitat type and soil category. Within the three habitat types the largest patches were found in deciduous forests and the smallest in grasslands while in the different soil categories, the largest patches were found in damp soils and the smallest in dry soils. Results are discussed in terms of plant species diversity on a regional scale.},

  abstract = {Since the first introduction of African swine fever (ASF) into the European wild boar population in 1957, the question of virus survival in carcasses of animals that succumbed to the disease has been discussed. The causative African swine fever virus (ASFV) is known to be very stable in the environment. Thus, carcasses of infected wild boar could play a major role as ASFV reservoir and thereby help to locally maintain and spread the disease in wild boar populations. To minimize this risk, removal of wild boar carcasses in ASF affected areas is regarded to be crucial for effective disease control. If removal is not feasible, carcasses are usually disposed by burial on the spot to avoid direct contact of wild boar to the infection source. In this study, carcasses of ASFV infected wild boar buried in Lithuania at different time points and locations have been excavated and retested for the presence of infectious ASFV by in vitro assays and for viral genome by qPCR. Soil samples potentially contaminated by body fluids have been additionally tested for viral genome. In seventeen out of twenty burial sites, samples of excavated carcasses were positive for ASFV genome. However, in none of the carcass samples ASFV could be isolated. On seven sites soil samples contained ASF viral DNA. These results unexpectedly negate the long-term persistence of infectious ASFV in wild boar carcasses independent from the burial time. In this context, sensitivity of ASFV isolation from carcass samples versus susceptibility of animals and doses needed for oral inoculation has to be further investigated. Furthermore, research is required to consider alternative ASF infection sources and drivers in the infection cycle among wild boar.},
